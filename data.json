Rabbi\n>Zimmerman was the seventh president of the college, which was\n>founded in 1875.\n>\n> Rabbi Paul J. Menitoff, the conference's executive vice president,\n>said its board approved the penalty on Monday, based on a\n>recommendation by its ethics committee, which looks into complaints\n>about the conference's 1,700 members.\n>\n> Rabbi Menitoff said that conference rules prevented him from\n>discussing the case but that the board decided Rabbi Zimmerman had\n>violated a part of the ethics code, paragraph 2A, which deals with\n>sexual conduct.\n>\n> It is included in the section of the code on \"personal\n>responsibility,\" which covers such matters as family life, personal\n>honesty and finances. It calls on rabbis \"to be scrupulous in\n>avoiding even the appearance of sexual misconduct, whether by\n>taking advantage of our position with those weaker than ourselves\n>or dependent on us or succumbing to the temptations of willing\n>adults.\"\n>\n> Hebrew Union, which trains men and women as rabbis and cantors and\n>in other graduate and professional fields, has 1,500 students on\n>campuses in Cincinnati, Los Angeles, New York and Jerusalem. Before\n>becoming president, Rabbi Zimmerman, 58, was senior rabbi of Temple\n>Emanu-El in Dallas from 1985 to 1995, and senior rabbi at Central\n>Synagogue in New York, from 1972 to 1985. He is married and has\n>four children. From 1993 to 1995, he was also the conference's\n>president.\n>\n> Rabbi Zimmerman's resignation was first reported yesterday in The\n>Cincinnati Enquirer and The Dallas Morning News.\n>\n> Efforts to reach him through the college and its officials were\n>unsuccessful. The college said it appointed its provost, Norman\n>Cohen, as acting president and would search for a permanent\n>replacement.\n>\n> Rabbi Menitoff said the conference followed \"the same process that\n>we'd follow with any rabbi in the conference in similar\n>circumstances.\" He said complaints against a rabbi are referred to\n>and investigated by the ethics committee. Depending on that\n>committee's findings, the conference may dismiss the complaint,\n>privately reprimand or publicly censure a rabbi or suspendn or\n>expel a rabbi.\n>\n> Rabbi Menitoff said the decision to suspend Rabbi Zimmerman was\n>\"very difficult and painful for everyone involved.\"\n>\n> Rabbi Eric H. Yoffie, president of the Union of American Hebrew\n>Congregations, the Reform movement's synagogue organization, said\n>Rabbi Zimmerman did not contest the findings or the judgment\n>against him but responded to the decision \"with great dignity.\"\n>\n> Rabbi Yoffie said that during his tenure as president, Rabbi\n>Zimmerman added younger scholars to the faculty and expanded the\n>college's Los Angeles branch so much that it will begin ordaining\n>rabbis in 2002.\n>\n> Another member of the conference, Rabbi A. James Rudin, emeritus\n>director of interreligious affairs at the American Jewish\n>Committee, said Rabbi Zimmerman's resignation was \"a real loss\" and\n>\"a shock to the movement.\"\n>\n> Hebrew Union's chairman, Burton Lehman, praised Rabbi Zimmerman as\n>\"a great, great leader.\" Mr. Lehman said that Rabbi Zimmerman's\n>resignation would \"have an impact\" but that the college was strong.\n>\n> \"Transitionally, we'll be fine,\" Mr. Lehman said. \"We have a\n>strong faculty that will carry this institution through this\n>tribulation.\"\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>The New York Times on the Web\n>http://www.nytimes.com\n>\n>/-----------------------------------------------------------------\\\n>\n>\n>Visit NYTimes.com for complete access to the\n>most authoritative news coverage on the Web,\n>updated throughout the day.\n>\n>Become a member today!

And, at the University of California's Berkeley campus \nthis year, a flashlight. \nAs state officials and utilities struggle to maintain the power supply during \nCalifornia's continuing energy shortage, administrators and professors at the \n31,000-student campus are planning for the possibility that rolling blackouts \nmay disrupt exams, which began on Friday and run through next Saturday.\n''People here are used to interruptions,'' Sara Abbas, 21, a senior \ncommunications major, said with a shrug as she studied in a cafe near campus. \n''People walking in, people running around buck naked and whatnot. People \nhave cut the power lines. They just reschedule.'' \nIn an e-mail message sent Wednesday, the executive vice chancellor, Paul R. \nGray, advised instructors to use ''individual discretion to decide the \ndisposition of their examinations once the exam has started.'' Among the \noptions: delay the test until the lights return; postpone it until a \nSaturday; grade the incomplete test; or cancel the exam altogether. \nProfessors are also encouraged to check a Web site to see if their exam rooms \nhave windows. ''In some classrooms,'' Mr. Gray noted, ''students may have \nsufficient natural light.'' \nThe rolling blackouts could hit most of the campuses of the University of \nCalifornia and California State University. The two systems are embroiled in \na legal dispute with Enron Energy Services, a Houston-based company that, in \nFebruary, cut short a four-year contract to provide electricity directly to \nthe universities. For now, the two systems -- among the largest energy \nconsumers in the state -- are being supplied by Pacific Gas and Electric and \nSouthern California Edison. \nThough several medical centers and the Davis, Los Angeles and Riverside \ncampuses of the University of California system are exempt from the \nblackouts, the rest of the campuses have been put on alert. \nAt Berkeley, the warning from Mr. Gray only heightened pre-exam stress \nlevels. \n''Stopping in the middle of a final would be detrimental to my grade because \nI save the hardest questions until the end,'' said Heidi West, 20, a \nsophomore majoring in political science. \nAaron Chung, a senior studying cognitive science, said it would be unfair to \ngrade half-finished exams because he often circled answers instinctively, \nplanning to return later with more care. ''The only thing I don't have a \nproblem with is if the professors give everyone A's,'' Mr. Chung, 23, said. \n''You have to be under a lot of duress for that to happen.'' \nGary L. Firestone, a biology professor, said he would move his 500-member \nclass out into the sunshine and tell students to spread their blue books on \nthe grass. But Jeff Good, a graduate student who teaches Introduction to \nSyntax and Semantics, said he would probably cancel the exam because the \nfinal counts for only 20 percent of the grade. \nThat is what Michelle Chen, a junior linguistics major in Mr. Good's class, \nis hoping for. \n''I would love a blackout,'' Ms. Chen said. ''I'm going to turn on my \nair-conditioner. My toaster, too.''\n\nCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. \n\n\nBusiness\nBritish Telecom\nPatience Wheatcroft\n\n05/12/2001\nThe Times of London\nNews International\nFinal 4\n55\n(Copyright Times Newspapers Ltd, 2001)\n\nBRITISH TELECOM has inflicted enough damage on itself in the past year. But \nothers are still lining up to put the boot in. Hours after the company \nannounced a Pounds 5.9 billion rights issue and the separation of cash-hungry \nBT Wireless, Moody's Investors Service lowered BT's credit rating. This \nthumbs-down will cost BT an extra Pounds 35 million a year on existing loans \nas well as making future working capital more expensive. \nThe timing is odd. One of the two other main agencies presented with the same \nBT proposals maintained its rating and the other edged it down so little that \nchange-of-rating clauses were not triggered. In the meantime, the market \nprices of BT debt have been rising. The Enron Cost of Credit, which measures \nthe overall risk premium on BT borrowing, has halved since mid February. Such \ncostly inconsistencies must focus more critical attention on the agencies, \nwhose power has grown out of proportion to their accountability.\nMoody's verdict is, however, peanuts compared with the cost to BT of the \nwhims of Stephen Byers and the UK competition authorities. Moody's will no \ndoubt be aghast to learn that Yell could be worth Pounds 1 billion less as a \nresult. \nIn 1996 the Monopolies and Mergers Commission found that BT's Yellow Pages \nhad an 85 per cent monopoly of its market and made it sign undertakings to \ncut prices by 2 per cent a year in real terms. The Office of Fair Trading has \nreviewed this report; predictably, it has found that the enforced price cuts \nhave kept competition down and kept Yell's market share up. \nThe reasoning behind OFT advice that annual real price cuts should be doubled \nis closed to scrutiny until Mr Byers has a new BT undertaking. But it appears \nto argue that the market is still a monopoly, so Yell must be charging too \nmuch, so prices should fall further. \nThe result, according to those formerly eager to buy Yell, is that a growth \nbusiness has been turned into a stagnant one, losing all momentum. This \nsounds typical of the dead hand of UK regulation. It must strengthen the \nresolve of BT's new leaders to remodel what the authorities so hate to the \ngreater advantage of shareholders.\n\nCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Here we go: What's the first thing that comes to mind when someone \nmentions Houston? \nTime's up. Your answers may have been energy, medicine or seemingly random \nacts of highway closure. But how about something very, very small? While \nHouston may not exactly be synonymous with all things tiny, we may want to \nstart giving more mind share to the world of the miniature. As technology \nadvances, Houston may owe a great deal to the study of small substances.\nNanotechnology is the study of creating functional structures on a molecular \nscale (the prefix \"nano\" means one billionth, or 10 to the ninth power \nnumerically). Its theories and practices give scientists the means to \nconstruct useful entities using the smallest known particle of unaltered \nmatter. \nBefore your eyes glaze over in a terminology-induced science class flashback, \nyou should hear some of the possibilities that this technology could afford \nresidents of the Bayou City and their respective commercial enterprises. The \npossibilities give the works of science fiction author Ray Bradbury a run for \ntheir money, and include producing computers the size of viruses or factories \nthat could fit neatly on your desk. Cancer-destroying robots could roam a \npatient's innards like mounted police at a spring break celebration. \nEventually, all diseases and mutations could be eliminated. And all \nmanufacturing processes would become waste-free, both in terms of the \nenvironment and from a business process standpoint. \nSound like science fiction? Maybe, but truth is rapidly catching up with \nfiction. A team of university researchers recently figured out how to make a \nfunctional switch out of a single organic molecule. Discoveries such as these \nhave spawned several branch fields of study including nanobiotics, NEMS \n(nanoelectromechanical systems) and nanomedicine. \nThis technology would surely change the world. But it would especially affect \nHouston. Applications for nanotechnology are a great fit for Houston's \neconomic landscape. The chemical industry already has begun conducting \nresearch in small-sizing certain chemical compounds. And the energy industry, \nstill our darling, has great interest in the power management possibilities \nof nanotech. This could be Houston's next great vehicle for economic \ndevelopment. \nNay-sayers have expressed caution regarding progress in this field on two \nseparate fronts. First on how distant potential commercial offerings remain; \nand secondly on the potential dangers of combining genetic engineering, \nnanotechnology and robotics (for fear of creating self-assembling intelligent \nmachines as often portrayed in science-fiction movies). But too much \ntechnological progress is happening at once for the possibilities not to whet \nthe appetites of the entire scientific and business communities. \nAlready, developmental overtures have been heard from Houston's little sister \nto the north. The Dallas-Fort Worth region and its growing base of \nsemiconductor, light assembly and defense industries are keeping a close eye \non developments in small science. In March, a private-sector company donated \n$2.5 million to the University of Texas at Dallas for nanotech research. And \na handful of Dallas-area groups have been quietly conducting research of \ntheir own. This money augments the federal government's nearly half-billion \ndollar allotment of 2001 research funding for nanotechnology. Houston has its \nown projects, but they receive far less publicity. \nHouston's public nanoscience efforts have been centered mostly on Rice \nUniversity's grand Turks of academia. Pushing the envelope of academic \nexcellence as usual, Rice's heavyweight research barons continue to generate \nand distribute knowledge on the many potential applications of this exciting \ntechnology. But as successful as they are, they receive far less publicity \nand support than other less commercially significant disciplines. \nOn May 29, leaders from the energy, medical and technology sectors will \nconverge at the Houston Technology Forum to discuss various technology trends \nthat will affect Houston's future. Will the keynote speakers (chief \nexecutives from Compaq, the Texas Medical Center and Enron) address the issue \nof what Houston is doing to prepare for advances in nanotechnology and its \npotential economic impact on the region? \nI certainly hope so. Energy, medicine and technology are the terra firma of \nHouston's economy. Each of these industry sectors could reap profound \nbenefits by bringing nanotechnology's concepts to light. \nSure, the fruits of this nascent science are still a long way off. But it's \ngoing to become remarkably important sooner than we think. So while \nHoustonians are well known for our love of largeness, it's time to think \nsmall. Let's take a careful evaluation of what this technology could mean to \nour city and its economic development.\n\nDrawing \n\nCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. \n\n\nA\nPanel plots new course for area's future / Education, economics, quality of \nlife top group's list of needed improvements\nMIKE SNYDER\nStaff\n\n05/13/2001\nHouston Chronicle\n4 STAR\n33\n(Copyright 2001)\n\nA group of prominent business executives, worried that Houston's reputation \nas an unpleasant place to live imperils its future, is developing a plan to \ntransform the city's educational system, urban design and economic base. \nThe work of the Center for Houston's Future, a nonprofit group affiliated \nwith the Greater Houston Partnership, reflects growing concern that Houston \nmust reposition itself as a vibrant, desirable destination if it is to \ncompete in an economic climate that empowers skilled workers to live wherever \nthey choose.\nCreating such a \"livable city,\" leaders of the effort say, would in turn \nenrich the lives of every Houstonian. \n\"The interests of the business community are fully aligned with the interests \nof the community at large,\" said Eugene H. Vaughan, a money management \nexecutive and board chairman of the Center for Houston's Future. \nA report prepared for the organization by a business-based task force \nrecommends that local leaders challenge long-held assumptions that have \ndiscouraged meaningful land-use planning. It sketches a vision of Houston 20 \nyears from now in which technology and other tools have revolutionized public \neducation, \"livable city centers\" have changed the physical landscape and \ncurrent civic leaders have groomed a new, more diverse generation of \nsuccessors. \nThe report argues that the business community's traditional leadership role \nin Houston's civic affairs should continue. But it suggests the models of \nbusiness influence that prevailed in \"the old days\" should be re-examined. \n\"Those were the days when oil was king, and Houston was the energy capital of \nthe world - the days when a handful of `big' leaders, including CEOs of major \ncorporations, could meet in a room together and decide on the future of \nHouston,\" the report states. \n\"But times have changed, and there is far less tolerance in Houston's highly \ndiverse, egalitarian society for a hidden oligarchy to run things, no matter \nhow benevolent those leaders might be.\" \nThe center's board includes top executives of some of Houston's most \nsuccessful and influential companies, including Enron Chairman Ken Lay; Ned \nHolmes, chairman and CEO of Parkway Investments/Texas Inc.; James Royer, \npresident and CEO of Turner, Collie & Braden Inc.; William White, president \nand CEO of WEDGE Group Inc.; and Jim Kollaer, president and CEO of the \nGreater Houston Partnership. \nVaughan said the stature of the board members is an indication that the group \nis not likely to generate plans that will simply sit on a shelf. \n\"They've got so many demands on their time that they're not going to fool \naround with something that is ill-conceived,\" he said. \nRice University sociology professor Stephen Klineberg, one of the experts who \nadvised the task force that generated the report, agreed that the center's \nwork could be very influential. \n\"This is the first time there's been a systematic, coordinated effort on the \npart of the business community\" to improve Houston's quality of life, \nKlineberg said. \nThe Center for Houston's Future was created in the early 1990s primarily as a \nsource of research information for the partnership, Houston's premier \nbusiness organization. But its role changed about two years ago, Vaughan \nsaid, when Holmes became chairman of the partnership and encouraged the \ncenter to take an aggressive approach to planning for the region's future. \nLast summer, the center organized three workshops attended by 36 people \nrepresenting a cross section of the business community. These 10-day, \nseven-night events, led by professional facilitators and featuring various \nguest speakers, produced a report outlining four possible future Houston \nscenarios. \nJames D. Calaway, a member of the center's board, said the details outlined \nin the four scenarios are intended to be \"illustrative\" and are not \nnecessarily the actions the organization ultimately will recommend. However, \nthey provide insight into the direction of the group's thinking, he said. \nIn the first scenario, based on the assumption that local planning and \ndecision-making proceed much as they have in the past, the workshop \nparticipants speculate that tension between the city and suburbs increases to \nthe point that the Legislature strips Houston of its annexation power. \nDevelopment is greatly restricted because of failure to meet clean-air \nstandards, property values plummet and the City Council must pass a large tax \nrate increase. \nHouston becomes a stronghold of low-wage, service-sector employment, and the \ngap between rich and poor widens: \"For many who live there, it's simply a \nlarge urban sprawl, adrift in the global economy, or it's a three-year \nhardship post on the way to something more desirable.\" \nScenario two suggests that Houston's leaders transform the educational system \nby developing a \"Teacher Network\" that delivers Internet-based educational \nresources into every classroom and teacher's home in the region. This in turn \nleads to a communitywide electronic educational network, with every home in \nthe Houston area connected to the Internet by 2007. \nThese efforts, combined with universal, full-day preschool care, lead to \nstate-of-the-art local schools by 2010, with almost universal high school \ngraduation rates and 75 percent of these graduates going on to college or \ntechnical training programs. \nThe report does not estimate the cost of these measures or identify how they \nwould be funded. Potential sources, Calaway said, include local, state and \nfederal tax money, private grants and reallocation of funds now being spent \non more traditional educational programs. \nIn scenario three, local leaders take bold steps to overcome Houston's \nreputation for sprawl, dirty air and lack of green space - perceptions that \nhamper efforts to attract the talent needed to keep the region economically \ncompetitive. \nThese leaders develop a vision of Houston based on the creation of \"livable \ncity centers\" - major activity centers targeted for redesign and \nredevelopment - and the connection of these centers through \"personal and \npublic transport in corridors that delight the eye.\" \nWithin the centers, streets are reconstructed to better accommodate \npedestrians. Financial incentives prompt developers to provide a wide range \nof housing styles, including substantial affordable housing. The Main Street \nlight rail line is built, succeeds spectacularly and is followed by more rail \nlines extending in various directions. \nTo accomplish these goals, the report states, local leaders must overcome \ntheir \"ingrained suspicion of planning,\" and the City Council must adopt \n\"new, more prescriptive development standards\" within the livable city \ncenters. Early successes lead to a public referendum authorizing the \nexpenditure of $8 billion over 20 years to create the \"livable city.\" \nScenario four focuses on making Houston a \"crossroads of the world economy.\" \nThe city's business leadership becomes broader and more diverse, and it turns \nits energy toward diversifying the economy. \nThe energy industry, adapting to the new economic climate, transforms its \nbusiness model and creates new, high-tech enterprises. Space, nanotechnology \nand biotechnology research help launch hundreds of companies that quickly \nbecome significant global players. \nThe workshop participants concluded that Houston must accomplish key elements \nof scenarios two, three and four if it is to become a \"true world-class city \nin which to live and conduct business.\" \nCalaway and Vaughan said the next steps will include designating committees \nto develop specific recommendations in each of the broad areas studied, such \nas education and quality of life. Working groups then will be established to \nbegin translating these ideas into policy, they said. \nAlthough the center is focused on the long term, they said, it must produce \nresults as soon as possible. \n\"If we do not get serious about this, 20 years from now we're going to be a \nlow-wage environment, putting people in very, very dead- end jobs,\" Calaway \nsaid during a recent presentation on the group's work to members of the \nnonprofit Gulf Coast Institute. \n\"We've got to get the quality of life right, but we've also got to make sure \nthat we educate these kids for our future.\"\n\nMugs: 1.

Its role is to build a pipeline under the Gulf between \nQatar and Abu Dhabi.\n\"The profit margin for Enron would be low. At present, the Dolphin project is \nbeing developed primarily as an upstream venture,\" an industry source told \nMEED. \nAnother industry publication, Middle East Economic Survey (MEES), reported \nlast week that the two other partners regarded Enron's estimated cost for \nconstructing and laying the 350-kilometre (220- mile) undersea pipeline as \ntoo high. \n\"There is talk of new partners,\" a source with TotalFinaElf, whose role is to \ndevelop a block in Qatar's giant North Field, told MEED. \"But whatever \nhappens, we are staying.\" \nOn March 14, Qatar and the UAE inked a 25-year term sheet agreement on the \nproject, setting the volume at two billion cubic feet (20 million cubic \nmetres) of natural gas per day. \nDifferences over pricing and volumes had put back the signing of the \nagreement for two years after a first statement of principle for Dolphin was \ninked by Qatar and UOG in March 1999. \nAccording to MEES, Qatar Petroleum and UOG have finally agreed on a gas price \nformula of 1.3 dollars per million BTU (British thermal units) following \n\"high-level political intervention from Qatar and Abu Dhabi\". \nTotalFinaElf and Enron are strategic partners in the multi- billion-dollar \nproject, each holding a 24.5 percent share in Dolphin Energy Limited (DEL), \nwith UOG retaining a controlling 51 percent stake. \nFrom Abu Dhabi, the gas is to be distributed inside the emirate and on to \nDubai and Oman. An extension to Pakistan through an undersea pipeline is also \nplanned, as part of a regional gas network. \nhc/rp\n\nCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

A Mae West look- alike hired for the event meandered \namong them, handing out cigars and sultry comments in her mermaid-cut white \ndress studded with faux pearls and a white feather boa twirled about her \nneck. \nIn the eight and one-half years since the 42-year-old Lober started Star \nFleet, he's seen everything from fire-eaters to hula dancers as entertainment \non the hundreds of custom cruises his staff of 70 puts together each year. \nLast year, the company booked 400 cruises, which translated into $2.3 million \nin gross sales, in events ranging from Gulf Coast versions of company picnics \nto a bat mitzvah with a Gilligan's Island theme. One guy recently plunked \ndown $2,000 to charter an entire boat for a date. \nOne of Lober's seven captains is, handily, a licensed minister for weddings. \nStar Fleet staff recently added squirt guns, Hula Hoops and limbo sticks as \nregular on-board equipment. \n\"It's a bizarre business,\" Lober said. \"Nothing seems unusual anymore.\" \nNearly all Star Fleet's cruises include dinner. His kitchen staff does the \nprep work for hors d'oeuvres and main courses on land near the marina, \ntransferring them to a generous galley on board before customers arrive. The \ngalley crew does the final cooking. \nStar Fleet Entertainment Yachts is one of about a dozen businesses of its \nsize in the country that provides strictly private charter yacht cruises, but \nLober has hundreds of competitors locally. \n\"I'm competing with caterers, hotels, restaurants - anyone in the eating, \ndrinking and party business,\" he said. \"People say there are two things \nyou're never supposed to own: a boat and a restaurant. I put a restaurant on \na boat.\" \nLast month, he launched what he believes is the first-ever water limousine, a \n30-foot yacht complete with wet bar, sound system, leather couches, TV and \nVCR that takes small groups to waterfront restaurants and bars, just like a \nlimo does on land. \nSometimes, his clients hop off and dine at one of the restaurants on the \nKemah Boardwalk while the limo is anchored beside it. In other cases, waiters \ndeliver the food to the boat, equipped with removable dining tables that can \nseat 14, and the customers dine while cruising Clear Lake. \nLober was a natural shoo-in for a career on the water. His father owned a \nsupply boat business in Houston and a fleet of shrimp boats based in \nTrinidad. He eventually became president of his dad's supply boat business \nafter getting a master's degree in maritime management from Texas A&M \nMaritime Academy in Galveston in 1981. \nBut he still had that idea from second grade that grew from living on a boat \nto providing exclusive entertainment on the water. \nIn 1986, he joined the Passenger Vessel Association, a national group of \nvessel owners that provides public or private cruises for gaming, ecotourism \nor other entertainment. He attended seminars, talked to boat owners, \nresearched trends in the industry and tried to figure out what it would take \nto float his idea. \nLober drew up plans for a boat big enough to accommodate up to 150 \npassengers, but with a three-foot draft to keep from running aground in the \nnotoriously shallow Clear Lake and Galveston Bay. \n\"I wanted to be able to take that boat anywhere on the lake,\" which is five \nfeet deep in places, he said. \nBankers were skeptical when he approached them for a loan. \n\"This was a new business in Houston that had never been done before,\" Lober \nsaid. \"They had no confidence. \n\"I finally got to the point where I'd just take my business plan into a bank \nand say, `I know I'm not going to get a loan - just look at what I've got and \ntell me what it needs,' \" he said. \nEven without a loan in place, Lober began hands-on research. During the week, \nhe still worked at his father's supply boat business, but flew to Fort \nLauderdale, Fla., on weekends to work as a deck hand and food server for a \ncharter yacht company to learn the business from the bottom up. \nAfter a year of loan seeking, he found a lender at the Passenger Vessel \nAssociation's annual meeting. Caterpillar Finance agreed to lend him 60 \npercent of the $950,000 in construction costs if he installed Caterpillar \nengines on the boat. \nConstruction took a year, during which Lober continued his research, serving \ndrinks on weekends aboard a charter boat on the Detroit River and Lake St. \nClair. \nFinally, Lober launched Star Gazer in October 1993. \nThe maritime academy might have taught him how to navigate by the stars, but \nit didn't prepare him for marketing. \n\"I didn't know what I was doing,\" Lober said. \"The first year, I spent \n$125,000 in marketing blunders,\" including a $50,000 mass mail campaign that \nhe called \"a total flop.\" \nMarketing was twice as expensive as he thought it would be and took twice as \nlong for potential customers to understand the concept he was trying to sell, \nhe said. Meanwhile, his boat sat in the stall for up to three weeks at a \ntime. \nLober had a $30,000 monthly overhead in debt service, office rental, \ninsurance and slip fees, and \"I still had to pay it if the boat didn't leave \nonce,\" he said. \nPanicked, he joined the Greater Houston Partnership to seek out ideas, and he \ngot one: target marketing. \nHe and his small staff scrutinized every detail about the people who used the \nboat and set out to find more like them. He set his sights on the corporate \nclient, which makes up about 70 percent of his business today. Corporate \ncustomers include Enron, Exxon Mobil, Shell, Continental Airlines and Katy \nMills mall. \n\"We have had our party with Star Fleet every year for five years,\" said Ravi \nLal, director of ethylene division of Technip, based in San Dimas, Calif. \n\"The first year, I wanted to do something special that I hadn't seen before. \nEverybody likes it, and everybody wants to come back.\" \nBusiness slowly began to build, and word spread. Lober added the 90-foot Star \nCruiser in 1997, the 74-foot Star Spirit in 1999, and brought in a fourth, \nthe Lake Limo, last month. Also in 1999, he bought 6 acres with 600 feet of \nwaterfront and built Star Fleet Marina. While part of that land is still \nundeveloped, it eventually will become a parking lot for 500 cars when Lober \nadds a fifth large yacht, Star Ship, sometime in the future. \n\"We plan to add Star Ship when we're turning down enough business from the \nother boats,\" he said. \nAfter more than eight years, Lober has yet to take home a salary, putting \neverything back into the business. \nThe more he puts back, the more business he can accommodate. \nBut Lober and his staff still keep close tabs on their customers. \n\"We track everything - which individuals, what type of event, whether they \nprefer sit-down dinners, how they heard about us - you name it,\" he said. \nIt's a lot of details. He knows that blackout shades, pull-down projector \nscreens and multiple microphone jacks are needed for presentations, and that \nsome clients like to be picked up at one of the Galveston hotels or other \nlocations on the Houston Ship Channel. \nIf a customer hires a deejay, a crewmember provides padding to put underneath \nthe CD player on the bandstand because dancing on the steel dance floor \ncauses the player to bounce. \nLober's three full-time cruise consultants handle charter buses to and from \nthe marina, limos, menus, photographers and decorations. They work with Star \nFleet's in-house florist and theme designer to provide floral arrangements \nfor sit-down dinners and Hawaiian leis of fresh orchids and hibiscus for a \nmajor retailer's party, for which the florist helped transform the boat's \nstanchions into palm trees. \nAnd consultants have their own suggestions, such as bestowing captains' hats \ninstead of the usual corsages to employees with top sales who were being \nhonored at a recent floating awards banquet. \nLober believes his company's custom service brings customers back. \n\"They handle all the details once, and after customers go on that first \ncruise, they're sold on the concept,\" he said. \"People love something \ndifferent. We provide a different kind of party. If they do it once, they \nusually want to do it again.\" \nBut cruises aren't limited to parties, Lober said. Customers have chartered \nboats for banquets, retreats, new product introductions, incentive awards \ndinners and for scattering loved ones' ashes. \nAbout 60 percent of Star Fleet's business is repeat and referral. The recent \ncorporate party featuring the Mae West look-alike was the fifth the company \nhas chosen to have with Star Fleet. \nPart of Lober's initial marketing problem - which continues today - is that \nHoustonians just don't realize how close to the water they are. \n\"It's not like Fort Lauderdale, where water is part of the landscape,\" he \nsaid. \"In Houston, there's no high-visibility location to see the water, just \none spot on Loop 610 that overlooks the Port of Houston. Even in Clear Lake, \nthere are only one or two places when you drive around the lake that you can \nactually see the water. We don't have a San Francisco Bay or New York Harbor. \nSo people have to be reminded.\" \nHe also has to deal with the misconception that only the very rich can afford \ncruises, Lober said. \n\"Some people think they can't afford a luxury yacht, but when they compare \nour complete package with upscale restaurants, hotel banquet facilities, \ncountry clubs and wedding manors, we are quite competitive,\" he said. \"And \nour food is gourmet quality. Just like a five-star hotel, we never cut \ncorners.\" \nEvent cruises start at $40 per guest including food, bar, entertainment, tax \nand gratuities. \nLober depends heavily on customer surveys to develop the service he and his \ncrew provide. And customers informally give Star Fleet staff new ideas with \nsome of the extras they bring aboard, such as the squirt guns, Mardi Gras \nbeads, Hula Hoops and limbo sticks. \n\"We learn a lot from our customers,\" he said. \"We see what they do, take the \nbest and give it back to them.\" \nBecause customer surveys indicate that about 20 percent of Star Fleet's \nbusiness comes from being seen on the water, Lober and his captains make \ntheir crafts as visible as possible whenever they take them out. The real \nopportunity for hot-dogging comes when a customer charters two or three \nboats, and they raft up to become the Star Fleet flotilla, with customers \nmoving from one boat to another. A three-boat charter can handle up to 375 \nguests. \nBut one boat can still do a lot of advertising. \nAt the recent corporate party, Mae West joined the other revelers who were \nslinging Mardi Gras beads at al fresco diners as Capt. Tony DeFore edged Star \nGazer close to the Kemah waterfront. They may not have known it, but they \nwere doing a little of Lober's public relations work for him. \nAs the boat pulled back into the Star Fleet Marina, Lober pointed out a barge \nunder construction. When it is finished - by the end of the year, he hopes - \nthe bottom floor will be a galley for food preparation, the second the Star \nFleet office and the third floor an 1,800-square-foot apartment. \nIt will kind of resemble that three-tiered wooden box he brought home from \nschool years ago, Lober says. \nAnd he's going to live at the top.\n\n\nPhotos: 1-2.

Policy makers and investors in the energy \nsector are still groping to find ways and means to improve the performance of \nthis key industry. \nAlthough private investments were expected to come in a big way in creating \nnew capacities, policy uncertainties and above all the poor financial health \nof the consumer, in most cases the SEBs, have posed major problems for power \nplant developers. \nAfter about ten years of liberalisation, the private sector has to its credit \nonly about 5000 MW and according to projections by experts investments in \ngreenfield projects are unlikely before four to five years. \nThe factors that have been taken into consideration in the current projection \nare almost inbuilt into the system. For one, there is a general agreement \nthat stressing on generation alone without doing much on the distribution \nfront has eroded the financial health of most SEBs. \n``Private power developers cannot be expected to invest in projects till they \nare assured that they will be paid for the energy produced, experts say. \nBut like the recent Montek Singh Ahluwalia report maintains, such reforms \ncannot be done overnight and will require minimum five to seven years before \nthey break even. \nThe sector has already seen major exits like Cogentrix and Powergen and if \nthe current trends are anything to go by it would not be long before Enron \ntoo says Sayonara India, claim sources in the power industry. \nIPPAI, an association for private power investments, feels that the flip-flop \nby the government as far as power policies are concerned have made it \ndifficult for investors to take decisions. \n``Take this as an example at one time there were more than 200 MoUs signed up \nfor private power projects, the government provided counter guarantees for \neight projects, of which only three have taken off. Of this the Enron project \nis already facing problems of nonpayment, says a senior source. \nAccording to estimates drawn up by financial institutions like Power Finance \nCorporation an organisation responsible for monitoring the financial health \nof the SEBs and helping them with their reform programmes almost all the SEBs \nhave registered a negative turnover. Which is why the financing or \nescrowability of SEBs across the country has been reduced to zero. \nAccording to Union power minister Suresh Prabhu, the states are now \nresponsive to changes and reforms and the recent drive initiated by the \nCentre to work with the state governments was expected to yield results. \nBut this sector has seen far too many committees which have failed to yield \nmuch hope and it is only sheer determination of SEBs and political will that \ncan help this backbencher.\n\nCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

There \nhas been a positive response both from the DPC and the MSEB after the \nmeeting. The central government will also reciprocate by participating in a \nmeaningful dialogue. The next meeting will really decide on how it all goes,\" \nPrabhu said. \nEarlier this week, in an e-mail to Dow Jones Newswires from Houston, Enron \nVice President John Ambler however, said, \"While we have constantly \nmaintained that we are open to continuing a dialogue towards resolving \nissues, this (Friday) meeting should in no manner be construed as an open \noffer from DPC to renegotiate the terms of the contract.\" \nThe Maharashtra state government contends that the price paid for electricity \nfrom the Dabhol power plant, India's biggest-ever foreign investment at $2.9 \nbillion, is \"unaffordable\" and seeks to renegotiate tariffs. \nA recent committee appointed by the government, the Godbole panel, \nrecommended that the power purchase agreement be renegotiated. \nDabhol has come under fire because of the relatively high cost of its power. \nCritics object to Dabhol charging 7.1 rupees ($1=INR46.8825) a kilowatt-hour \nfor its power, compared with INR1.5/kwh charged by other suppliers. \nThe 2,184-megawatt DPC project in Maharashtra has been mired in financial \ndisputes after the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, its main customer, \nfailed to pay the December 2000 and January bills. The Godbole panel is \nworking toward lowering the DPC's power tariff and allowing the sale of \nexcess power to the federal government or its utilities. A restructuring of \nthe DPC's stakeholding may also be on the agenda. \nThe Maharashtra government has asked the committee to try to negotiate a \nrevised agreement within a month. The DPC currently operates a 740-megawatt \nnaphtha plant contributing about 0.7% to India's installed capacity. Enron \nhas maintained that work will be completed by the year-end in the second \nphase of the Dabhol project that will add 1,444 MW to its capacity. The plant \nwill switch from naphtha to liquefied natural gas as a fuel source in 2002. \nTexas-based Enron has a 65% stake in the DPC and is the project's largest \nshareholder. Other shareholders include the MSEB with 15%, and General \nElectric Co. (GE) and Bechtel Enterprises (X.BTL) with 10% each. \n-By Himendra Kumar, Dow Jones Newswires; 91-11-461-9427; \nhimendra.kumar@dowjones.com\n\nCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

OFFICIALS of Enron India today met the expert committee \nheaded by Dr Madhav Godbole to discuss the fate of Enron's Dabhol Power \nCompany. \nMr A.V. Gokak, Union Government representative, who was appointed only last \nnight, could not attend the meeting due to the short notice.\nLenders to the project who were to attend the meeting stayed away. \nInstead, Mr A.G. Karkhanis, former Executive Director, Industrial Development \nBank of India, attended as observer on behalf of foreign and Indian lenders, \nMr Vinay Mohan Lal, Energy Secretary, told reporters here after the meeting. \nWhen asked about Enron's reluctance to renegotiate, Mr Lal said: \"They are \ncoming again on May 23. What does that mean?\" \nThough none of those present at the meeting was willing to give more details, \nsenior State Government officials had earlier told Business Line that the \nState would be willing to discuss phase II only after a decision on the \nrebate slapped on DPC. \n\"Basically our strategy will be to bring the Rs 401- crore rebate payable by \nDPC to the centre-stage,\" the official said. \"The company has not mentioned a \nsingle word about the rebate in any of their letters to either the MSEB or \nthe State. And we, on the other hand, have discussed anything but the rebate \nin our letters to DPC,\" he said. \nMr Wade Cline, Managing Director, Enron India, did not comment on whether the \ncompany would issue the preliminary termination notice. \nThe Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) Chairman, Mr Vinay Bansal, and \nMr Lal had last evening briefed the Democratic Front constituents about their \nstand vis-a-vis Enron. \nThey are understood to have told the political brass of the State that MSEB \ndoes not need the second phase of the Dabhol power project. \nThey categorically said MSEB would not buy power from DPC-phase II, it is \nlearnt. \nMSEB also reiterated its stand that DPC should adjust the dues owed by it \nagainst the non-performance penalty. \nSenior MSEB officials said the board had replied to the arbitration notice \nissued by DPC and made its position clear. The board is of the opinion that \nDPC should adjust Rs 213 crore - the December and January bills - against the \nRs 401 crore penalty for performance default. \nThe State Government also has backed the MSEB in its replies to the three \narbitration notices served on it. It has said that since MSEB does not accept \nthe charges - non-compliance with the power purchase agreement (PPA) - \nleveled against it, the State is not bound to pay. \nThe Centre too is understood to have backed MSEB in its preliminary reply to \nthe conciliation notice from DPC. \nToday's meeting was attended by Mr Cline, Mr Neil McGregor, President, DPC, \nMr Mukesh Tyagi, Vice-President, DPC, and Mr Sanjeev Khandekar, VP, DPC, and \nMr Mohan Gurunath, Chief Financial Officer, DPC. \nAmong the renegotiation panel members, Mr Deepak Parekh, Mr E A S Sarma and \nMr Kirit Parikh were also unable to attend. The next meeting is scheduled on \nMay 23, Mr Lal said. \nGokak nominated to panel: The Government has nominated former fertiliser and \ntelecom secretary, Mr A.V. Gokak, to the arbitration committee involving \nDabhol Power Company (DPC). \nThe Power Ministry had earlier mooted the additional solicitor general, Mr \nHarish Salve's candidature for the job. \nThe conciliation process, however, has been hanging fire as the third \nconciliator is yet to be appointed. Dabhol Power Company had written to the \nCentre last month seeking six names for selection of a mutually acceptable \nconciliator to kick- start the conciliation process. \nDPC's letter to the Finance Ministry was seen in the context of the \nsubstantial delay between the initiation of the conciliation process three \nweeks ago and the finalisation of the conciliators. Soon after the \nconciliation process was initiated, DPC decided to invoke political force \nmajeure and moved in for arbitration - a prelude to termination of the \nproject. \nOur Bureau\n\nCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

PETER DeFAZIO D-ORE.\nThe state of Oregon should consider buying investor-owned Portland General \nElectric to help protect Oregonians from gyrations in the electricity market, \nU.S. Rep. Peter DeFazio declared Friday. \nGov. John Kitzhaber reacted politely and said he'll explore the idea, but \nothers said it's a long shot because of political, financial and timing \nfactors. \nCritics said the proposal appeared aimed more at attracting attention to \nDeFazio's potential candidacy for governor than anything else. \nSeveral companies already are considering buying the utility, but DeFazio \nsaid state ownership could help keep PGE customers' electricity rates low and \ngenerate profits that could help the rest of Oregon. \n\"I believe this is an extraordinary opportunity and a way that we can \ninsulate almost a quarter of our population and a core of Oregon's business \ncommunity from the craziness that is going on in the energy wholesale \nmarkets,\" said DeFazio, D-Ore. \nPGE serves about 725,000 retail customers, mostly in the Portland area, and \nis owned by Houston-based Enron Corp. PGE's sale to Nevada's Sierra Pacific \nResources for $3.1 billion officially fell apart last month. Other possible \nbuyers include Northwest Natural and ScottishPower, which owns PacifiCorp. \nWhile Enron and PGE officials declined to comment Friday, legislative leaders \nshowed no particular enthusiasm for DeFazio's idea. \n\"I appreciate his efforts, but I don't think it's the right idea at this \ntime,\" said House Speaker Mark Simmons, R-Elgin. He said the state already \nhas a package of bills aimed at spurring more energy production and \nconservation. \nSenate President Gene Derfler, R-Salem, said he'd be willing to sit down and \ntalk with DeFazio. \"I would not just shut the door,\" he said, but he doesn't \nplan to devote much work to the proposal. Derfler questioned whether state \ngovernment could run a utility as efficiently as a business. \nDeFazio said a PGE purchase would offer several benefits. State ownership \nwould put control of PGE in local hands instead of those of a faraway \ncorporation such as ScottishPower. For PGE customers, state ownership would \nprovide some protection and stability in electricity rates. It also would be \na good investment that would pay for itself and perhaps pump revenue back \ninto the state's coffers. \nThe purchase could be financed with tax-exempt bonds sold by the state. \nDeFazio said state Treasurer Randall Edwards had told him the idea was \"in \nthe realm of possibility.\" \nDeFazio's idea is an intriguing one and could provide some benefits, said Bob \nJenks, executive director of the Citizens' Utility Board, which represents \ncustomers of investor-owned utilities such as PGE. \nJenks said the primary benefit would be that, if the state bought PGE, the \nutility would be able to buy lower-priced electricity from the Bonneville \nPower Administration, which is required to sell power at lower rates to \npublicly owned utilities. However, a publicly owned PGE wouldn't be able to \nbuy the lower-priced BPA power for about five years because of electricity \nsales contracts that already are in place. \nAnd even if PGE were able to buy lower-priced BPA power, that wouldn't \nnecessarily translate to lower electricity bills for PGE customers, Jenks \nsaid. In addition, he said it could increase rates for other publicly owned \nutilities because the BPA has a shortage of cheap hydropower. \nThe state Public Utility Commission would have to approve any sale of PGE, \nbut outgoing PUC Chairman Ron Eachus criticized DeFazio's proposal, saying it \nhad the potential to increase rates both for PGE customers and for publicly \nowned utilities. He also said it seemed designed to get political attention \nfor DeFazio's potential candidacy. \n\"I think we're in the political season where people are proposing grandiose \nschemes that aren't very well thought out, and this seems to be one of \nthose,\" Eachus said. \nDeFazio conceded that a high-profile proposal focused on a Portland-area \nissue such as the ownership of PGE would be a good way for a candidate to \nbuild support for a run for governor, but he said that had nothing to do with \nhis plan. \nYou can reach Dave Hogan at 503-221-8531 or by e-mail at \ndavehogan@news.oregonian.com.\n\nCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. \n\n\nCongressman suggests state buy PGE\nBy CHARLES E. BEGGS\nAssociated Press Writer\n\n05/11/2001\nAssociated Press Newswires\nCopyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\n\nSALEM, Ore. (AP) - Congressman Peter DeFazio on Friday proposed that the \nstate buy Portland General Electric as a way to hold down power costs. \nThe Democrat outlined his plan after presenting it to Gov. John Kitzhaber, \nwho said he would ask his energy advisers to analyze it.\nPGE is Oregon's biggest electric utility, serving more than 700,000 \ncustomers. DeFazio said a state purchase of the company could insulate many \nOregonians from \"the craziness in power markets.\" \nDeFazio said the state could buy the company by issuing revenue bonds and \nhave the utility operate as a public power entity. \nHe said the purchase would give the state a diverse mix of transmission \nrights along with hydropower, gas, coal and renewable energy sources. \n\"While I have not exhaustively researched the proposal, it does appear to be \nfeasible,\" said DeFazio, an opponent of electric deregulation. \nEnron Corp., the Texas-based owner of PGE, is trying to sell the utility. \nSierra Pacific last month abandoned its plan to buy PGE for $3.1 billion, \nciting increasing difficulties in the current market and the political \nenvironment in the West. \nKitzhaber said he's not opposed to the idea of the state buying a private \nutility, as long as it would benefit consumers. \nDeFazio said PGE has been a profitable company, and putting it in public \nownership could give it preference over private utilities for the Bonneville \nPower Administration's hydropower. \nThe congressman's suggestion wasn't welcomed by the Legislature. \n\"Thanks, but no thanks,\" said House Speaker Mark Simmons. \n\"Philosophically, I think it's the wrong approach,\" he said. \"We have a \nbipartisan package of bills dealing with the issue.\" \nAmong those are his measure to delay partial electric deregulation for large \nbusinesses and a bill to speed up the process for siting temporary generating \nplants. \nSenate President Gene Derfler didn't reject the idea, but said the \nLegislature doesn't have enough time in the current session to take on a job \nlike a utility purchase.\n\nCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Portfolio market exposures can range from +325% to\n-175% of net assets.  This is clearly different from the largely\nnon-leveraged stock-picker funds you already own.  I would consider this to\nbe a predominately large-cap investment (I think of it as an index fund with\na brain and on steroids - call me and I'll explain that comment in more\ndetail).\n\nJuniper Crossover Fund, LLC: Managed by OrbiMed Advisors, and focused on\nglobal biotech and pharma.  Up to 30% participation in private equity.  This\ncould be a way to get you some private equity exposure with a world-class\nmanager.\n\nTamarack International Fund, LLC: Long/short stock-picker fund focused on\nthe international mid-cap market.  I feel this fund is very similar in style\nto the managers you already own, but would give you exposure to the\ninternational markets that you currently lack.  This is a new fund and the\nfirst closing will probably be in June.\n\nOf course, the summaries above are for information purposes only and do not\nconstitute an offer to sell or solicitation of an offer to buy interests in\nthese funds.

The voting will take place through conference calls criss-crossing \nthe globe at 6.30 pm, Indian Standard Time. Even though the three Indian \nlenders_ the Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI), the State Bank of \nIndia (SBI) and ICICI_ have decided to vote against the proposition, they \nwill not be able to block the move.\nTechnically, the proposal can be passed if four per cent of lenders are in \nfavour of the termination notice. In effect, it will be passed if one of the \n25 lenders casts its vote in favour of it. So, it's almost a foregone \nconclusion that DPC will be asked to issue its termination notice. \nMultilateral agency J-Exim, which has provided guarantees, will not \nparticipate in the exercise. Barring J-Exim, other financial intermediaries \nincluding global arrangers ABN Amro, Citi, ANZIB, CSFB and other banks and \nOPIC will cast their votes tomorrow. \"In the first round, Indian lenders put \ntheir foot down and refused to give clearance to the termination notice. \nThistime around they will not be able to block the move any more. The Indian \nlenders alone cannot save the controversial $3 billion as some of the foreign \nlenders are in favour of issuing the termination notice,\" said a source. The \nIndian lenders are in favour of completing the project without any time and \ncost over-run. They have disbursed about 80 per cent of their Rs 1,500 crore \nworth of loan commitments to phase II of the project, 93 per cent of which is \ncomplete. The trial run is expected to commence in June. The board of the \nDabhol Power Company has already authorised Enron India managing director, K \nWade Cline, to serve a termination notice as and when he deems fit. At a \nmeeting of the lenders last month in London, the foreign lenders were keen \nthat the termination notice be served in the face of defaults by the \nMaharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) and the Union government's refusal \nto honour the counter-guarantee of Rs 102 crore for the December bill. The \ndomestic lenders are not covered by the counter-guarantee if the contract is \nterminated.

(SCG) said in a \nstatement on Tuesday it will add around 200 million cubic feet a day, or \nabout six percent, to its pipeline system by the end of the year in order to \nmeet the surge in demand for gas-fired power generation. \nToday's announcement comes two months after SCG, a unit of Sempra Energy , \nproposed to increase capacity on its system by 175 mmcfd, or five percent.\nBoth projects will add around 11 percent of new gas capacity to its \ntransmission system this year, the company said in a statement. \nIn its latest proposal, called the Kramer Junction Interconnect, SCG said it \nwould build a 32-mile pipeline link to the Kern-Mojave pipeline system that \nwill allow it to deliver around 200 mmcfd into its system. \nThe new capacity would be enough to drive three 500-megawatt power plants or \nenough gas to serve 1.4 million residential customers a day, the statement \nsaid. \nSCG, the nation's largest gas utility with more 18 million consumers in \ncentral and Southern California, said utilization of its intrastate \ntransmission system in the past nine months had jumped from 75 percent to \nover 95 percent, due largely to the rise in gas-fired power generation. \nThe company's announcement is the latest in several proposals to expand gas \npipeline capacity to California, where demand for gas is expected to jump \nbecause of the number of gas-fired power plants being built or scheduled for \nconstruction. \nGas is already used to generate about a third of California's electricity. \nAnd since April 1999, the state has approved 13 major gas-fired power plant \nprojects with a combined generation capacity of more than 8,900 megawatts. \nNine gas-fired power plants, with a total generation capacity of more than \n6,000 megawatts, are under construction. \nOver the past two months plans to build or expand gas lines serving \nCalifornia have been announced by Enron unit Transwestern, Williams Cos' Kern \nRiver Transmission, El Paso Corp. units El Paso Natural Gas Co. and Mohave \nPipeline Co., Pacific Gas & Electric Corp. unit National Energy Group, \nQuestar Corp. , Calpine Corp. , and Kinder Morgan .\n\nCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

If such measures are carried out and electricity prices fall to \nmatch the levels of other industrialized nations, Japan's industrial sector \ncould trim its costs by Y4 trillion, Enron said.\nAt a seminar on power industry deregulation hosted by Enron, the company \nasserted that Japan's deregulation in such areas as wholesale electricity \nauctions in 1996 and bulk retail sales last year has not brought significant \nbenefits to end-users. \nNew suppliers entering the market only account for a combined 0.4% of the \nentire electricity sector, Enron said, criticizing the fact that power plant \nfacilities are mainly concentrated among electric power companies. \nRegarding prices, an official representing operators of power generation \nfacilities asserted that \"industrial-use electricity prices in Japan are \nstuck at a high level at around Y13 per kilowatt, compared with Y5 in the \nU.S., Y3 in Canada, Y9 in Germany and Y4-Y8 in Southeast Asia.\" \nIn fact, department store operator Takashimaya Co. (8233 or J.TKA), which \nlast November switched to new market entrants for part of its electricity \nsupply, was able to cut costs by Y450 million in the first year, said a \ncompany official. \nEnron hopes to generate competition by urging Japanese electric utilities to \nspin off different operations, analysts say. If the number of power \ngeneration facility operators increases, this will help bolster Japan's \nelectricity trading market, an area in which Enron has a strong business \ninterest. \nSplitting electricity operations into generation, transmission and \ndistribution is expected to open the electric utility network to new \nentrants. This will boost transparency in the fees that electric power \ncompanies charge for transmitting power on behalf of the operators of power \ngeneration facilities, Enron says. \nCiting the power shortage in California, however, Japan's electricity sector \nhas strongly opposed such spin-offs, stating that generation and distribution \nmust be part of a single continuum to ensure a stable supply.\n\nCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

(Enron), \nwhereby trading data from certain contracts listed on Enron's online trading \nsystem, EnronOnline will be included in the computation of three Alberta Gas \nPrice Indices. \nNGX acquired the AECO \"C\" & NIT Daily Spot, One-Month Spot, and Bid-Week Spot \ngas price indices (Alberta Gas Price Indices) from Canadian Enerdata Ltd. \nlast September. Subsequent to the acquisition of the Alberta Gas Price \nIndices, NGX has provided real-time information to its customers on the \nestablishment of the weighted average price indices based on transactions \nconducted through NGX's trading system. Canadian Enerdata Limited continues \nto publish the Alberta Gas Price Indices in the Canadian Gas Price Reporter.\nPeter Krenkel, President of NGX, stated, \"We believe that inclusion of data \nfrom EnronOnline will serve to make our price indices among the best in North \nAmerica. The industry has been very supportive of the visibility and \nintegrity we are able to bring to the Alberta Gas Price Indices, which \nremoves the guesswork around gas price index methodology. However, after \nreviewing the matter with Enron and other industry participants, we \nrecognized that Enron had legitimate concerns and the industry felt that \n\"more is better\". The inclusion of data from the highly liquid EnronOnline \nsystem should improve the quality of our price indices even further.\" \nRob Milnthorp, President and CEO of Enron Canada commented, \"We are very \npleased to have EnronOnline transactions included in the Alberta Gas Price \nIndices. This will provide industry participants with a more comprehensive \nsource of data and a better opportunity to manage risk around these price \nindices as they are now assured that all their transactions on EnronOnline \nwill be included in the computation of the Alberta Price Indices.\" \nThe inclusion of EnronOnline data satisfies the principal claims made by \nEnron in their legal action against NGX, Canadian Enerdata Ltd., OM and \nRichard Zarzeczny and Enron has agreed to discontinue the legal action \nagainst those parties with the conclusion of this arrangement. \nNGX and Enron are planning to implement the necessary system changes by \nAugust 1, 2001 but in any event will provide at least thirty days notice to \nthe industry. Once in operation, data from transactions in the relevant \ncontracts listed on EnronOnline will be fed to NGX in real-time.

(ENE) pulls out of the $3.5 \nbillion Dolphin gas project, in which the company holds a 24.5% stake, the \nU.A.E. Offsets Group, or UOG, will consider other companies to replace it, a \nUnited Arab Emirates industry source close to the project said Tuesday. \nIndustry sources Monday said Enron is considering withdrawing from the \nproject because it doesn't believe it will be profitable.\nDolphin, an agreement signed two years ago by UOG and Qatar Petroleum, plans \nto bring 2 billion cubic feet a day of natural gas from Qatar's offshore \nNorth Field to Abu Dhabi and onward to Dubai. \nEnron and TotalFinaElf (TOT) each hold a 24.5% stake in the project, while \nUOG owns the remaining 51%. \nEnron is set to focus on the midstream part of the project - gas \ntransportation - which requires building a 350-kilometer pipeline from a \nprocessing plant in Ras Laffan, Qatar, to the Taweelah terminal in Abu Dhabi \nand the Jebel Ali terminal in Dubai. \nThe U.A.E. source said originally, it was thought that the U.A.E. government \nwould fund the pipeline, which is estimated to cost around $1 billion. \nHowever, more recently, the source said the U.A.E. suggested that Enron put \nup the money itself. \nOther industry sources said Enron and TotalFinaElf also had to pay \nsignificant fees to join the project. TotalFinaElf will\noperate the upstream part of the project, which includes developing\nnatural gas reserves in two blocks of the North Field. First wells are \nscheduled to be drilled in the second half of 2001 and come onstream in \n2005. \n\nLast week, the Middle East Economic Survey reported that the foreign partners \nhaven't yet agreed on the precise details of their working relationship or on \nthe price of the pipeline. \nQatar Petroleum and Dolphin Energy Ltd., a subsidiary of UOG, signed an \ninitial agreement in March for the upstream section of the project. A full \nagreement is expected to be concluded in September, the source said. \n-By Dyala Sabbagh, Dow Jones Newswires; 9714 331 4260; \ndyala.sabbagh@dowjones.com\n\nCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

She declined to\ncomment on a potential bid by Oregon.\n     The state should act swiftly, DeFazio said, citing press\nreports that the U.K.'s Scottish Power Plc, owner of PacifiCorp,\nthe largest utility in the U.S Northwest, may bid for Portland\nGeneral.\n     Scottish Power, based in Glasgow, Scotland, would have more\nthan 70 percent of Oregon electricity customers if it added\nPortland General, raising ``serious regulatory concerns about\nmarket power,'' he said.\n\n                            Bond Issue\n\n     Oregon could issue bonds to purchase Portland General, using\nthe utility's profits to pay the debt, DeFazio said. The state\nmight run it as a public utility or a cooperative, he said.\n     Enron and Sierra Pacific called off the Portland General sale\nbecause of laws passed by Nevada and California legislators that\nslow the deregulation of their wholesale power markets.\n     California and Nevada have blocked sales of power plants by\nutilities. Sierra Pacific had to sell a stake in a Nevada power\nplant that sells power to California to win regulatory approval of\nthe Portland General purchase.\n     Average power prices on the California-Oregon border this\nyear have soared ninefold to $296.34 a megawatt hour over the year-\nearlier period. A megawatt hour can light 750 average California\nhomes for an hour.\n     Shares of Enron fell $1.76 to $$56.99. They've fallen 31\npercent this year.\n     Sierra Pacific rose 9 cents to $16.09. Scottish Power rose 9\npence to 492 ($7) in London.\n\n\n\nEnron to Provide Gas Prices to NGX, Drops Lawsuit (Update1)\n2001-05-15 16:26 (New York)\n\nEnron to Provide Gas Prices to NGX, Drops Lawsuit (Update1)\n\n     (Adds closing share price.)\n\n     Houston, May 15 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the world's\nbiggest energy trader, agreed to provide natural-gas pricing\ninformation to NGX Canada Inc. and drop a C$100 million\n($64.7 million) suit against the Canadian gas exchange.\n     Enron sued NGX in November after the Internet exchange, a\nunit of the company that owns the Stockholm Stock Exchange,\nchanged providers of its gas-pricing data and didn't include\ntrades on EnronOnline, Enron's Internet exchange, when calculating\ngas-price indexes.\n     Calgary-based NGX agreed to include EnronOnline trades in\ncalculating its Alberta Gas Price Indices by August, Enron\nspokesman Eric Thode said.\n     NGX, owned by Stockholm's OM Gruppen AB, is used by about 90\npercent of Canadian gas traders, and many traders use EnronOnline\nto sell gas from western Canada, the biggest supplier of the\ncleaner-burning fuel to the U.S.\n     Houston-based Enron fell $1.76 to $56.99."

An example would be a deal done with KUKUI Inc. on November \n8th, 2000.  It is booked as deal numbers Q86409.1, Q86409.2, Q86409.3, and \nQ86409.4.  These are four separate and unique deal numbers and therefore \ncount as a total of four deals.     \n\nWe understand that the trade desk may consider the deal in this example as \njust one large deal with 4 different parts.  Unfortunately,  the EOL \nReporting Database has no way of telling whether or not these types of deals \nare distinct different deals or part of one larger deal.  Since this \ncurrently can not be known, the EOL Reporting Database uses the most \nconservative approach and counts them all as individual deals.  This results \nin a higher OTC deal count and thus a lower EOL percentage of all deals.\n\nIf you have any further questions , please don't hesitate to ask.\n\nPete Berzins\nx57597\n\n"

If \nthey don't see any messages, there are two reasons: \n (1) They are not valid users. Their names have not been added into the NT \nWeb_GasTraders Group yet. Please contact Chrysti Hardy to add their names \ninto the group.\n (2) There is no new messages added yet.\n\n4) Click on \"Comments\" button to add messages: there will be a popup window \nwhen user clicks on \"comments\" button. There are two ways to send the \nmessages after typing the \nmessages into the text box:\n (1) just simply press enter to send the message. or\n (2) click on \"send\" button to send the message.\n\n5) After the message has been sent, The message will be displayed on the main \nwindow immediately, the rest people who are online will get the new message \nin less than 30 seconds. This time can be reduced to as less as 1 second. \nHowever, I would not recommend to reduce the time interval less than 10 \nsecond.  Because each time the browser refreshes the screen, the screen will \nbe blink. Users don't want the screen blink every second while they read the \nmessages.\n\n6) All messages will be cleaned up daily at 6:00PM. If they like to clean \nthem up later than 6:00PM, please let me know. I can reset the time.\n\nNote: Right now the application is under test environment. If they like it, I \nwill move it into production environment soon.\n\nLet me know any feedbacks.\n\nThanks,\n\nFangming\n\n\n\n\n"

The \nadministration of Mayor Lee Brown was believed to have favored Montgomery \nWatson's chief competitor, Azurix Corp., an arm of local energy giant Enron \nCorp. \nThe water corporation, known as \"the Hawk,\" voted 5-0 to grant the contract. \nIf approved by City Council, the contract would give the company 2 1/2 years \nto get the plant up and treating raw lake water. \nIt was initially expected that the plant, which will be designed to handle 40 \nmillion gallons of water daily, could cost as much as $150 million to build. \nThe Hawk board asked the vying companies to modify their bids several times, \nand that caused the competitors to lower their prices. \nThe contract calls for the Hawk to pay a monthly operating fee of $157,000 \nwhen the plant is working. And Montgomery Watson could be required to \nconstruct, at the Hawk's option, an additional 40 million-gallon-a-day plant \nexpansion for $32 million. \nBut the details of how the plant will be financed have not been determined. \nThe Hawk board discussed borrowing money using the city's credit rating on a \nshort-term basis until it could develop long-term financing by selling bonds \nitself. \nThe initial customer for the water is the city of Houston, which would repay \nthe Hawk the cost of producing the treated water. The hope is that the plant \neventually will provide water to other entities in the area as well. This \nplant is part of an area plan for the treatment of surface water that could \ncost about $2 billion to implement. \nCity Councilman Carroll Robinson, who heads the council infrastructure \ncommittee, said he expects to hold two hearings about the contract. One would \nfocus on how the Hawk board picked Montgomery Watson. A series of three \nrecommendations from City Hall staff recommended Azurix. \nHawk board members said Montgomery Watson's prices were lower by millions and \nthat Azurix plans to sell Azurix North America, the body that would oversee \nthis contract. \nThe second City Council hearing will focus on financing, Robinson said. \"In \nmy mind, how the city will pay for this construction is as important as who \nwill do it,\" Robinson said. \nThe Hawk board, appointed by Brown and approved by City Council, has been \nheavily lobbied by the contenders for the job. \nBecause City Council does not have to follow the Hawk recommendation, new \npressure has begun at City Hall. The third bidder, U.S. Filter Operating \nServices, part of a French company, has been heavily lobbying some council \nmembers to switch the contract to it. \nSome members of the Azurix team -- people at companies that would have gotten \nwork had Azurix gotten the job -- have written letters complaining about the \nHawk procedures as well. \nJohn M. Stokes, president and chief executive officer of Azurix, penned the \nfirst such distressed missive. In April, he wrote to Hawk board Chairman \nDavid Berg complaining of the \"deleterious economic effect\" on Azurix of the \nboard's decision to negotiate with Montgomery Watson. He requested that Berg \nanswer a series of questions in writing explaining why Azurix didn't get the \njob. Berg didn't do so. \nAlthough that letter had a threatening tone, Amanda Martin, president of \nAzurix North America, said no threat was intended and the letter simply \nindicated how upset the team was when it first learned Azurix wasn't chosen. \nAzurix was the rumored front-runner for months. \n\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tINTERNATIONAL ECONOMY: Enron may cut stake in Gulf gas project \nFinancial Times; May 15, 2001\nBy ROBIN ALLEN\n\n\t\tThere are growing fears that Enron, the US power company, may withdraw or \nsharply reduce its stake in the Gulf's Dollars 10bn Dolphin gas export \nscheme, one of the most ambitious of its kind in the region. \n\t\tEnron officials have refused to comment on reports that the company is \nreconsidering its position as a minority shareholder in Dolphin Energy, in \nwhich France's TotalFinaElf (TFE) also has 24.5 per cent. \n\t\tHowever, one industry specialist said yesterday Enron was talking of \n\"selling\" at least part of its shareholding. \n\t\tThe threat raises critical issues for western companies seeking to profit \nfrom accessing state-owned oil and gas in the Gulf. \n\t\tThe project was launched two years ago by Abu Dhabi, the wealthiest of the \nUnited Arab Emirates, to promote energy security for the Gulf. But Abu \nDhabiis seen as a prime example of a state where prestige and opaque domestic \npolitical considerations can be as important as profitability in such a \nlarge-scale project, especially in the early stages. \n\t\tDolphin's majority owner is UAE's Offsets Group (UOG), an offshoot of Abu \nDhabi's defence procurement industry. In March, Dolphin, a relative newcomer \non Abu Dhabi's energy scene, signed a Dollars 3.5bn agreement with Qatar to \nexploit and pipe up to 2bn cubic feet a day of gas from Qatar's prolific \nNorth Field to Abu Dhabi. \n\t\tQatari gas is the source of Abu Dhabi's long-term energy strategy, and Enron\n's role was to develop, at a profit, the downstream section, primarily to \nconstruct and lay the 350km pipeline from Qatar to Abu Dhabi. \n\t\tEnron is not a specialist in energy production or pipeline fabrication, but \none of its main aims, according to one analyst, was to gain access to the gas \naccruing to it from the Qatar deal and then trade it on. Sheikh Zayed Bin \nSultan al-Nahyan, Abu Dhabi's ruler, disapproves of commodity trading. \n\t\t\"If the Qatar-UAE gas deal was going to be profitable\" for western energy \nmajors, asked one senior western diplomat, \"then why are the serious US \nenergy majors not involved?\" For more reports see www.ft.com/globaleconomy \n\t\tCopyright: The Financial Times Limited\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n\nJAPAN: Enron says high power rates costing Japan.\n\n05/15/2001\nReuters English News Service\n(C) Reuters Limited 2001.\n\nTOKYO, May 15 (Reuters) - A senior executive of U.S. energy giant Enron Corp \nsaid on Tuesday that Japan could save an estimated four trillion yen ($32.45 \nbillion) in annual costs if electricity rates were cut to the average of \nmembers of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). \n\"If you were to pare Japanese industrial electric rates to the OECD \naverage...savings to all...customers would be about four trillion yen per \nyear,\" Enron Corp Vice President Steven Kean told a seminar in Tokyo.\nSpeaking at a seminar on electric power deregulation, Kean said that \nindigenous factors such as steep land prices and a lack of natural energy \nresources were often blamed for Japan's high electricity rates. \nBut he said these factors were not sufficient to explain Japan's high \nelectricity rates. \nA report commissioned by Enron Japan Corp showed that in 1998 Japan's \nelectricity rates for industrial users were 16.81 yen per kilowatt hour (kWh) \ncompared to a second highest rate of 12.44 yen in Italy. \nJapan's business sector has expressed concern at the nation's high \nelectricity rates, saying that it blunts their competitive edge on the \ninternational market. \nKean also drew parallels between Japan, in the midst of deregulation, and \nCalifornia which has been suffering from a power shortage since deregulating \nits market in 1998. \nThese included the length of time that authorities in Japan took to issue \npermits to allow the construction of new power plants, he said. \n\"The regulatory structure in Japan is very strict...just like in California,\" \nKean said. \nNorth America's biggest buyer and seller of electricity, Enron gained its \nfirst foothold in Japan in 1999 when it established affiliate E Power Corp. \nIn April of last year, it set up subsidiary Enron Japan Corp. \nKean urged Japan to step up measures to open up its power market, a process \nhe said held many benefits. \nJapan is in the process of deregulating its power market. Since March last \nyear, large-lot consumers have been free to chose their suppliers. The \nmeasure liberalised an estimated 30 percent of the power market and ended \nJapan's 10 power utilities regional monopoly. \nHowever, industry watchers note that there have been very few new entrants \nand that further deregulation measures must be taken for rates to fall. The \nJapanese government is due to review the process in 2003.\n\nCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The government is to review the partial \nderegulation by 2003 for further deregulation. \nJapan should then introduce spot electricity trading such as futures and \nderivatives to alleviate risks of complicated price volatility for power \nproviders, Hatta said. \nHatta and other experts attending the seminar said further deregulation \nshould destroy the systems that have supported the country's high power rates \n- regional monopolies and the fair rate return method, under which all costs \nare levied on prices. \n\"There is absolutely no need to set the same (power) prices\" nationwide, \nHatta said. Power companies should make the opaque transmission fees \ntransparent and set them accordingly with regional demand, he said. \nYoshinori Omuro, vice president of Takashimaya Co.'s (J.TKA or 8233) \nmanagement department, acknowledged the slow progress of the deregulation. \nTakashimaya, a major department store operator, has shifted to Diamond Power \nCorp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mitsubishi Corp. (J.MIB or 8058) as its \npower supplier at two of its 18 stores, with \"strong back-up\" from the \nMinistry of Economy, Trade and Industry. \n\"Despite the deregulation, the situation isn't where we can negotiate with \npower utilities to reduce (electricity costs). We have no choice but select \nindependent power providers,\" Omuro said. \n-By Maki Aoto, Dow Jones Newswires; 813-5255-2929; maki.aoto@dowjones.com\n\nCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Local media reports earlier in May said \nEnron was pulling executives out of India and relocating them elsewhere. \nDabhol has invoked payment guarantees issued by the state and federal \ngovernments, but neither has stepped forward to foot the bill. \nGOVERNMENT GUARANTEES \nBanks often demand sponsor or host government guarantees to lessen risk \nbefore financing energy projects, which have long lead times and high capital \nexpenditure. \nGovernments are keen to provide guarantees to attract foreign investment. \nGuarantees may cover shortfalls in production, default of customer payment or \neven changes in market conditions. \nBut such guarantees do not always provide the desired safety net and analysts \nsaid the legal systems in many emerging nations are simply not efficient \nenough to back these agreements. \nEnron's experience in India highlighted the risks of power investment in \nemerging countries and the unpredictability of government guarantees, they \nsaid. \n\"Guarantees like that are painful for companies and for polititicians they're \neven more so,\" said John Vautrain, vice president at Purvin & Gertz in \nSingapore. \n\"If the call is substantial, it's going to be bad.\" \nRobert Booth, director of the Bardak Group in West Perth, Australia, was more \npessimistic and reckoned some companies might take a lead from Enron and shy \naway from emerging Asian nations. \n\"Investors will pull back from these countries until they see that there is a \nproperly functioning legal system that gives them assurance if they have to \ncall in a government guarantee,\" Booth said.\n\nCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

DPC had indicated it was not in a position to fulfil \nits contractual obligations to MSEB because of political circumstances beyond \nits control. \nMSEB in a reply on Monday denied Enron's allegation of 'political \ncircumstances' and said there was no reason why it should have felt insecure. \n\"Such a step was necessary under the Power Purchase Agreement and related \nsecurity documents to notify the board of 'certain events and to enforce our \nrights',\" DPC had said. However, according to MSEB, such a step by DPC was \nuncalled for. \nFor DPC, invoking the force majeure clause was necessary as 'certain events \noccurred that are beyond the reasonable control of the affected party (DPC)'. \nMSEB has expressed surprise in a letter on Monday. \nThe energy major had dispatched the notice to MSEB, as an affected party, \nwhich had been subjected to \"concerted, deliberate and politically motivated \nactions of state government, the Government of India and the Board, which \nwill have a material and adverse effect on DPC's ability to perform \nobligations under PPA\". \n\"Given the cumulative effect of these political actions, DPC determined that \nthe political force majeure declaration is an appropriate mechanism for \nproviding that notice, and that is an appropriate and necessary step in \nprotecting DPC and its stakeholders' rights,\" the statement added. \nHowever, for MSEB this was 'yet another move' from Enron to avoid paying Rs \n402 crore penalty the MSEB has slapped on it for failing to supply \nelectricity as per the agreement. \nMSEB, in today's letter, reiterated its suggestion to adjust December 2000 \nand Januray 2001 bills, against the Rs 800 crore penalty it has slapped on \nEnron for not supplying electricity as per demand. \nMSEB has refused to pay DPC's December 2000 and January 2001 bills worth Rs \n213 crore.\n\nCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The \nmeetings began two weeks ago.\nA senior foreign oil executive in the kingdom expected an answer to his \nfirm's bid by the end of this week or the start of next week. \n\"The SPC is holding a crucial meeting today (Monday) and tomorrow. bin were \ntold we would get an answer to our proposals either this weekend or early \nnext week,\" the executive told AFP. \nThe negotiating committee made detailed recommendations after meeting with \nthe representative of 12 international oil companies (IOCs) which are bidding \nfor the three multi-billion projects, the executive said. \nThe committee, comprising ministers who are also SPC members, is headed by \nForeign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal. \nThe gas projects, which would be the first foreign investment \nin the kingdom's energy sector since nationalisation in 1961, are located in \nthe South Ghawar field near Al-Hufuf in the Eastern Province, Shaybah in the \nEmpty Quarter desert, and the northern Red Sea area. \nThey cover 440,000 square kilometres (176,000 square miles), making it the \nworld's largest area for hydrocarbon investment. \nUS majors Enron and Occidental in a joint bid, as well as Chevron, \nConocokilometres, ExxonMobil, Marathon, Phillips and Texaco have been \nshortlisted for the Saudi projects. Rounding out the list are European firms \nBP Amoco, Eni, Royal Dutch Shell and TotalFinaElf. \nExxonMobil, Shell and TotalFinaElf are in the bidding for all three ventures. \nThe investment involves gas exploration and production, setting up \npetrochemical industries and power and water desalination plants. \nThe projects, called the natural gas initiative, are to be carried out \nsimultaneously by consortia of two to three firms in cooperation with Aramco, \nthe national oil company, on long-term basis for up to 30 years, the \nexecutive said. \nAramco has been working to double the Saudi gas network's capacity from the \ncurrent 3.5 billion cubic feet (105 million cubic metres) per day to seven \nbillion cubic feet (210 million metres) daily in 2004. \nSaudi Arabia, which sits on top of the world's biggest oil reserves, has \nproven natural gas reserves of 220 trillion cubic feet (6.6 trillion cubic \nmetres).-AFP\n\nCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

                "Content": " Jarnold.nsf\n\nRe: trucking LNG to California - \n\nThe short answer is that trucking LNG to California is not a feasible option \nfor endusers other than companies with LNG-fueled vehicle fleets. There are a \ncouple of reasons for this. \n\nFirst, California has a relative abundance of LNG fueling stations but only \ntwo plants capable of regasification. One serves Borrego Springs, a small, \naffluent desert community near San Diego. The other is dedicated to military \nand industrial supply near Sacramento. I spoke this morning to Applied LNG \nTechnologies, which is based in Amarillo and has the second largest LNG truck \nfleet (after Transgas in Massachusetts). It shouldn't be a surprise that I \nwas not the first to call regarding this question. While ALT's fleet is \noperating at capacity - trucking LNG from liquefaction plants in Wyoming and \nTopock, Arizona - it's serving its normal fleet customers in Southern \nCalifornia and Nevada, and Arizona. The Topock, AZ plant is owned jointly by \nALT and El Paso, and receives gas from El Paso for liquefaction and \nsubsequent loading onto trucks.\n\nSecond, LNG trucks, unlike LNG tankers, carry an extremely small volume. The \naverage truck carries 10,000 gallons of LNG, which translates roughly into \n820,000 cubic feet. ALT has about 23 vehicles so potentially one could \ndeliver 18.8 mmcf. However, these trucks don't regasify LNG, they merely \ntransfer it into storage. \n\nThe only really viable option for putting gas into the pipeline system would \nbe a portable pipeline unit, of which ALT has the only one (it's under \nrepair). It can deliver high pressure gas at 1800 cubic feet/minute (2.6 \nmmcf/day if it runs 24 hours). It has connections for two LNG trucks at a \ntime - one live and one backup, so it can operate continuously. In the past, \nALT has used the unit to cover industrials who had a supply outage for some \nreason. \n\nI'm going to continue gathering info on domestic LNG peakshaving plants, etc. \nI think the opportunity may lie more in future, more strategically located \npeakshaving plants rather than LNG trucking arbitrage. \n\nPlease let me know if you have specific questions.\n\n\n\n"

In the following week, Saudi Arabia \nis expected to communicate its decision to the oil companies from both sides \nof the Atlantic that have been vying for a role in the three projects. By the \nend of the month, the chosen consortium members and Saudi officials are \nexpected to agree on which three companies will lead the projects. This will \nbe a prestigious role in a country that is the world's largest oil exporter, \nhas more than a quarter of the world's oil reserves and has the fifth-largest \nreserves of natural gas. \nAs with any negotiations for such huge projects, industry rumors abound. All \nthree so-called oil supermajors -- Exxon Mobil Corp., Royal Dutch/Shell Group \nand BP PLC -- have been mentioned as project leaders, particularly for the \nplum Ghawar project, named after the world's largest onshore oil field, whose \nenvirons are expected to yield large volumes of gas. The Ghawar project, \nknown as Core Venture 1, is projected to require about $15 billion in \ninvestment. Core Venture 2 is on the Red Sea coast. The third project is in \nShaybah, a recently developed oil field in the kingdom's Empty Quarter, a \nsoutheastern region bordering the United Arab Emirates. \nThe companies say they have no idea who will be named to the consortia, or \nwho the Saudis will choose from a short list of 11 companies -- Exxon Mobil, \nShell, BP, Chevron Corp., TotalFinaElf SA, ENI SpA, Enron Corp., Occidental \nPetroleum Corp., Marathon Oil Canada Inc., Conoco Inc. and Phillips Petroleum \nCorp. -- to lead each project. But they all have their hopes. \n\"We would be very disappointed if we are not the lead operator\" for the \nShaybah project, said Archie Dunham, Conoco's chairman and chief executive. \nSince Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah invited major oil companies to return to \nthe kingdom in October 1998, negotiations have focused on such broad issues \nas the scope of the projects and their integrated nature -- from exploration \nand production of gas to the making of petrochemicals and electricity -- as \nwell as the notion that the companies will need adequate returns on their \ninvestment. \nSoon, the project leaders will have to start the bargaining on such issues as \nthe roles to be played by national champions Aramco and petrochemicals \ncompany Saudi Basic Industries Corp. \n--- \nAlexei Barrionuevo in Houston contributed to this article. \n--- Population Pressure\n\nSaudi Arabia is opening up its energy sector, in a bid to bolster the \neconomy as population grows\n\n-- Population\n21.3 million (growing over 3.5% per year)\n\n-- Unemployment rate*\n27%-35% of males\n\n-- Real GDP Growth Rate\n7.6%\n\n-- Oil Production\n9.3 million barrels per day\n\n-- Natural-Gas Reserves\n204.5 trillion cubic feet\n\n-- Natural-Gas Production/Consumption\n1.68 trillion cubic feet\n\n*Unofficial estimate for 1999\n\nNote: Figures are estimates for 2000 except natural-gas production,\nwhich is for 1999\n\nSource: U.S. Energy Information Administration\n\nCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - The White House team developing a national energy plan has \nmet with more than 130 interest groups, from environmentalists and unions \noften at odds with Republicans to major Bush supporters given private \nsessions with Vice President Dick Cheney. \nThe vice president, Cabinet secretaries and others on a special task force \nhave solicited ideas behind closed doors, hoping the privacy would encourage \na free exchange of ideas.\nThe White House has declined to provide names of participants - even to \nCongress. \nBut interviews with participants detail a massive outreach where diverse \ninterests have met with task force executive director Andrew Lundquist. \nCheney's time has been reserved for meetings with more select participants \nsuch as power wholesaler Enron Corp. and the Edison Electric Institute, both \nGOP donors. \nHouston-based Enron is the world's top buyer and seller of natural gas and \nelectricity. \n\"The way the task force is set up, they don't have the staff or time to have \na huge host of companies come through the door. They have told us to work \nthrough our associations to the extent we can,\" said Don Duncan, vice \npresident of government relations for Phillips Petroleum Co. \nParticipants said the meetings, typically 20 minutes to 45 minutes, included \nabout a dozen to 100 interest group members and a few task force members and \nstaff. \nNo details were disclosed. Instead, administration representatives summarized \nthe nation's energy problems or listened as groups briefly offered background \nand proposals. Many sent detailed materials to the task force outlining their \npriorities. \nAt a half-hour meeting in late March with White House strategist Karl Rove \nand Bush economic adviser Larry Lindsey, nuclear energy executives tried to \nmake sure the two knew about the production records the industry has set over \nthe past few years. At one point, Rove asked if anyone was looking to build a \nnuclear power plant. An executive with Exelon replied that his company was \nthinking about it, meeting participants said. \nEnergy Secretary Spencer Abraham has attended several meetings, including one \nwith Teamsters President James Hoffa and an hourlong session in California \nwith Democratic Gov. Gray Davis, who contends the administration has done \nlittle to help the power-strapped state. \nLike other governors, Davis was asked to provide one page on the state's \npower crisis, including a description of the problem, an anecdote about it \nand possible solutions. \n\"They're asking for a one-page memo on possibly the biggest crisis ever \naffecting the state, with a massive ripple effect for the nation,\" Davis \nspokesman Steve Maviglio said. \"I think it demands more attention than a \none-page memo.\" \nCheney spokeswoman Juleanna Glover Weiss said the task force has been \nstudying the California problem almost daily. \nAt a meeting between Abraham and about 100 coal industry representatives in \nlate April, task force staffers handed out a briefing packet that outlined \nnational energy needs, and then they listened to industry proposals. \n\"I thought the purpose was one, to reassure people in the coal industry that \ncoal was going to play a large role in the energy mix, and essentially when \nthe plan is unveiled that they're going to be looking to people to help \nmartial this through Congress,\" said Bill Banig, a lobbyist for the United \nMineworkers Union. \nWhite House officials said the meetings are not designed to encourage \nlobbying and that task force members were carefully instructed on what was \npermissible under federal law. \nCheney's meetings included Enron, Edison Electric Institute, California \nRepublicans, and the senators from Nevada, home to the proposed Yucca \nMountain federal nuclear waste site. The vice president plans to meet with \nthe renewable-energy industry this week. \nEnron ranked among Bush's top 10 presidential campaign contributors, giving \nmore than $110,000, and helped sponsor a $7 million party fund-raiser last \nmonth. \nThe Edison Electric Institute gave Republican candidates more than two-thirds \nof its $193,000 in contributions last year. Edison International, whose \nholdings include the Southern California Edison electric utility, is also a \nmajor donor, giving $535,000 to Republicans last year and $330,000 to \nDemocrats. \nEnron spokesman Mark Palmer said Cheney met with Enron executives because the \npower wholesaler is a respected member of the industry, not because it was a \ncontributor. Enron wants the administration's energy plan to ease electricity \ntransmission bottlenecks, give companies incentives to invest in new \ntransmission and make the wholesale power market as open as possible, he \nsaid. \nTom Kuhn, the institute's president, said it is \"totally ludicrous\" to think \npolitical donations played a role. \nCheney's meeting with Edison board members, held at the institute's \ninvitation, lasted 15 minutes to 20 minutes. Cheney spoke about the task \nforce process, Kuhn said. He said Cheney's remarks were consistent with the \nvice president's public statements. \nEdison wants to see new generation and transmission systems built, including \ncoal, natural gas and nuclear and hydroelectric power, Kuhn said. \nDemocrats in Congress sought a list of participants in the meetings, but \nCheney's office responded by only listing broad categories and no names. That \nhas left fodder for political attack. \n\"You can't just take advice from one interest group or set of interest groups \nwhen you do these things,\" said Dave Albersworth of the Wilderness Society, \nwhose group has met with Lundquist but was denied its request to talk with \nCheney. \nWeiss countered that the energy task force has collected information from \nmore than 130 groups since January in an \"almost Herculean effort\" to draw \ninput from all sides. \n\"People deserve the right to petition their government and not expect a full \nlaundry list of who's called to be announced,\" she said. \nEnron spokesman Palmer said he is not seeking such privacy. \"I'm happy to \ntell people what we're advocating for. I'd rather be talking about policy \nthan about politics,\" he said. \n--- \nOn the Net: \nWhite House Energy Task Force: \nhttp://www.whitehouse.gov/news/usbudget/blueprint/bud10.html\n\nCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

But they can \nrightly say, echoing Mark Twain's words, that reports of their collective \ndemise are exaggerated. \n\t\tIndeed, many in the UK-based exploration and production companies, dubbed \n\"independents\" in the sense of being untied to any refining and marketing, \nbelieve they have more of a role than when their kind first started operating \nin the North Sea 30 years ago. \n\t\tAfter the takeovers in recent years of Lasmo, Monument and British Borneo, \nthere may only be about a dozen significant UK-based \"independents\" left. Yet \nthey amount to virtually the entire European E&P sector: the only significant \nexception being Lundin Oil of Sweden. \n\t\tMany of the UK independents began life as local partners of US companies in \nthe 1970s when the Labour government of the period gave preference to \nconsortia with a local flavour. \n\t\tBut this rationale disappeared when the Thatcher government took a more \nfree-for-all approach to letting anyone develop the North Sea - though at the \nsame time it did create the biggest UK independent by floating off British \nGas' oil interests as Enterprise Oil. Enterprise is the only UK independent \nthat is more than a niche or regional player. As such its E&P assets would be \na significant addition to an oil major, hence the persistently rumoured \ninterest in taking it over. \n\t\tAs the North Sea became more competitive and difficult, some of the UK-based \nindependents began to look elsewhere. \"Unlike US independents which have \nalways tended to be less interested in drilling outside North America, those \nin the UK have always tended to be more sympathetic to exotic parts of the \nworld\", says Mark Redway of Teather and Greenwood. \n\t\tUnfortunately, the obvious exotic new province that happened to open up in \nthe early 1990s was the former Soviet Union. One company, Ramco Energy, \ndipped in and out very successfully, recently selling its 2 per cent stake in \nthe Azerbaijan International Oil Consortium for Dollars 150m (Pounds 104.8m). \n\t\tOther UK independents - Aminex, Soco and Dana Petroleum - ventured into \nRussia and got stuck. While Aminex finds it hard to downplay Russia (because \nit has little elsewhere), Soco these days stresses its Mongolia and Vietnam \noperations. Another UK independent, JKX Oil & Gas, went into Ukraine, a \ncountry notorious for non-payment of energy bills. With diplomatic help from \nTony Blair, the prime minister, JKX has just survived a legal attempt to rob \nit of its Ukraine assets. \n\t\tTwo other independents have sunk more fruitful roots in Asia. \"Cairn Energy \nnow has as big a stake in Bangladesh's gas production as Shell, and it would \nbe left, if Enron (the US energy company) were to quit India, as the biggest \nforeign player in India,\" says Iain Reid of UBS Warburg. Premier Oil is now a \nsubstantial Asian gas company, with production in Burma, Indonesia and \nPakistan and long term contracts in Thailand and Singapore. \n\t\tBut there are risks in these Asian ties. The obvious political one concerns \nBurma. Last year the UK government asked Premier to quit Burma because its \npresence was helping the military regime. Premier refused, and said it would \ncarry on. \n\t\tThe other risk, according to Mr Redway, is economic and it applies also to \nCairn. Because there is no real world market for gas, Cairn and Premier are \n\"very dependent on the strength of the local economies\". But then, Mr Redway \nis an analyst who believes that independents' competitive edge lies in \nexploration rather than production. He therefore rates Fusion Oil & Gas \nhighly as \"the purest exploration investment opportunity in the E&P sector\". \n\t\tDana similarly vaunts its exploration expertise, but to a different end. Its \ngoal, according to Tom Cross, chief executive, is to find oil and then swap \nexploration for production assets. \"This avoids the expensive development \nstage of building platforms and pipelines and so on\". Then at the other end \nof the spectrum are production-focused companies, such as Paladin, Tullow Oil \nor Venture Production. Roy Franklin, Paladin's chief executive, makes no \nbones about his company's scavenger strategy, spotting rich pickings \noverlooked by the majors. \n\t\tThe majors are not always ready to sell, particularly recently when the oil \nprice rise has widened the gap in price expectations between buyers and \nsellers. \n\t\tBut Paladin was last year able to buy PetroCanada's assets in Norway, and is \nthis year interested in bidding for some of what the Norwegian state is \nselling off. \n\t\tAs its name suggests, Venture Production, a private Aberdeen-based company \nwith North Sea and Trinidad operations, is focused on extraction, not \nexploration. And so are other private companies such as Intrepid, Consort \nEnergy and Highland Energy, formed in the past three or four years. This new \ngeneration of company tends to be more cautious than the older one. \n\"Exploration has probably been the best way to destroy shareholder value,\" \nsays one executive. \n\t\tThe other risk the new oilmen want to avoid is the vagaries of the stock \nmarket. \"By focusing on production, the new companies are more predictable in \nterms of cash flow and earnings,\" says Mike Wagstaff, Venture's finance \ndirector. \n\t\tCopyright: The Financial Times Limited\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n\nNews\nBush energy team covers all the bases\nSharon Theimer, Associated Press\n\n05/14/2001\nChicago Tribune\nNorth Sports Final ; N\n13\n(Copyright 2001 by the Chicago Tribune)\n\nThe White House team developing a national energy plan has met with more than \n130 interest groups, from environmentalists and unions often at odds with \nRepublicans to major Bush supporters. \nVice President Dick Cheney, Cabinet secretaries and others have solicited \nideas behind closed doors, hoping the privacy would encourage a free exchange \nof ideas.\nThe White House has declined to provide names of participants even to \nCongress. \nBut interviews with participants detail an outreach program where diverse \ninterests have met with task force executive director Andrew Lundquist. \nCheney's time has been reserved for meetings with more select participants \nsuch as power wholesaler Enron Corp. and the Edison Electric Institute, both \nGOP donors. \n\"The way the task force is set up, they don't have the staff or time to have \na huge host of companies come through the door.

Gray Davis, who contends the administration has done \nlittle to help the power-strapped state. \nLike other governors, Davis was asked to provide one page on the state's \npower crisis, including a description of the problem, an anecdote about it \nand possible solutions. \n\"They're asking for a one-page memo on possibly the biggest crisis ever \naffecting the state, with a massive ripple effect for the nation,\" Davis \nspokesman Steve Maviglio said. \"I think it demands more attention than a \none-page memo.\" \nCheney spokeswoman Juleanna Glover Weiss said the task force has been \nstudying the California problem almost daily. \nAt a meeting between Abraham and 100 coal industry representatives in late \nApril, task force staffers handed out a briefing packet that outlined \nnational energy needs, and then they listened to industry proposals. \n\"I thought the purpose was one, to reassure people in the coal industry that \ncoal was going to play a large role in the energy mix, and essentially when \nthe plan is unveiled that they're going to be looking to people to help \nmarshal this through Congress,\" said Bill Banig, a lobbyist for the United \nMineworkers Union. \nWhite House officials said the meetings are not designed to encourage \nlobbying.\n\nCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Those companies had been grouped \nunder three core venture consortia - South Ghawar, Red Sea and Shaybah. \nFor ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch/Shell, securing the lead role in Saudi \nArabia's core ventures would entitle them to operate the package and get the \nbiggest slice of the projects, analysts said. \nOther industry sources said ExxonMobil, the world's biggest energy company, \nwas tipped for the top slot in core venture 1 (South Ghawar) as well as in \ncore venture 2 (Red Sea). \nRoyal Dutch/Shell was in pole position for core venture 3 (Shaybah), the \nsources added. \nBoth oil supermajors already have significant foreign investment in the \nkingdom and feature as top customers of Saudi oil, the analysts said. \nENERGY DRIVERS \nAn urgent need to create jobs and grow the economy are driving Saudi Arabia's \nlandmark energy opening. \nAnd analysts said big oil companies were prepared to help the kingdom achieve \nthose aims even if the return on their investment was relatively low. \n\"Major oil companies just cannot miss this opportunity,\" a source said. \"The \ngas projects will show profits.\" \nBut just how much revenue oil companies will generate by selling water and \nelectricity in the Saudi domestic market remains to be seen. \nOn paper, at least, the kingdom's domestic gas sector looks set for \nimpressive growth. \nDomestic gas demand, now running at about 3.4 billion cubic feet per day, is \nforecast to grow at more than seven percent a year over the coming decade. \nSaudi Arabia has meanwhile made clear that its prized oil sector, the world's \nbiggest, remains off limits. \nEven so, oil companies still hold out hope for eventual involvement in oil, \nthe kingdom's lifeblood. \n\"The companies are just as happy with gas, but oil remains the ultimate \nobjective,\" a regional analyst said. \n\"Saudi Aramco is still putting up strong defence barriers, but eventually \nthey could open up the oil sector once they feel comfortable working with the \nmajors.\" \nThe Saudi gas initiative seeks foreign oil companies' help in developing the \nkingdom's known gas reserves as well as investment in downstream projects fed \nby gas supplies, such as power and desalination. \nThe following companies have been shortlisted for the gas projects: \nCore venture 1 (South Ghawar Area) - ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch/Shell, BP , \nTotalFinaElf , Chevron and ENI . \nCore venture 2 (Red Sea Area) - TotalFinaElf, ExxonMobil, Marathon , Enron\n/Oxy , Conoco , Royal Dutch/Shell. \nCore venture 3 (Shaybah Area) - Royal Dutch/Shell, ExxonMobil, Marathon, \nConoco, TotalFinaElf, Phillips and Enron/Oxy.\n\nCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

These were then passed \non to the SPC for final approval. \nSaudi Arabia's Crown Prince Abdullah, who heads the SPC, is in Bahrain Monday \nattending a Gulf Cooperation Council leaders' summit along with Saudi \nArabia's foreign minister, Saud Al Faisal, who heads the gas negotiating \ncommittee. \nSaudi Arabia invited international oil companies in October 1998 to \nparticipate in proposals for downstream gas projects and upstream gas \nenhancement. \nAfter a series of meetings between the negotiating committee and IOC's in the \npast year, the following companies were shortlisted for each project. \nRoyal Dutch/Shell Group (RD), BP PLC (BP), Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), Chevron \nCorp. (CHV), Total Fina Elf S.A. (TOT) and ENI SpA (E) for Core Venture 1, \nthe $15 billion South Ghawar Area Development. \nFor Core Venture 2, the Red Sea Development, Enron Corp. (ENE) and Occidental \nPetroleum Corp. (OXY) are bidding jointly and Exxon Mobil, Total Fina Elf, \nMarathon Oil Canada Inc. (T.M), Shell and Conoco Inc. (COCA) were listed. \nAnd for Core Venture 3, the Shaybah area, Total Fina Elf, Conoco, Phillips \nPetroleum (P), Enron and Occidental, Exxon Mobil, Shell and Marathon Oil were \nlisted. \n\nWith all those shortlisted expected to play some role, the immediate and \nessential question for each of the IOC's is whether they will be selected to \nlead and operate a project, with Core Venture 1 the most sought after, \nindustry sources said. \nExxon Mobil and Shell have been tipped as frontrunners for this venture. \nThe operator's role will be more crucial than ever here as it will be \nresponsible for directing further negotiations on the projects at hand which \nwill lead to final deals probably by year end. \nAlso, operators are expected to decide and direct how the project's \nindividual and large components will be developed, details the Saudis haven't \nfinalized, sources said. \nThe three ventures have been estimated at a combined value of about $25 \nbillion. \n-By Dyala Sabbagh, Dow Jones Newswires; 9714-331-4260; \ndyala.sabbagh@dowjones.com\n\nCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

THE second part of the Dr Madhav Godbole committee report is \nexpected to be submitted to the State Government on May 15. \nWhile the first part of the report recommended renegotiation of the power \npurchase agreement with Enron's Dabhol Power Company, the second part is \nexpected to suggest bifurcation of the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, \nsources said. The committee, which has been given the mandate to negotiate \nwith Enron officials to make DPC power more acceptable, had a marathon \nmeeting on May 11 to finalise the second half of the report.\n\"The committee has been considering the bifurcation of MSEB,\" a source said. \n\"The idea is to try and separate the distribution from generation and \ntransmission.\" While generation and transmission can be controlled by the \nState, there may be a suggestion to privatise the distribution arm. Over 1.5 \nlakh MSEB employees had gone on a strike to oppose a Bill to unbundle the \nboard into three divisions - generation, transmission and distribution - due \nto fear of privatisation. \nMSEB, the State's leading power company, has been facing huge losses due to \ndelay in payments and theft of power. The second part of the report is \nexpected to address the problem in detail. \nPart one of the report submitted on April 10 had said: \"...none of the \nsolutions espoused for independent power producers, in general, and DPC, in \nparticular, is tenable without the reforms of MSEB, especially its \ndistribution business, which it shall address in part II of the report.\" \nThe report is expected to \"suggest appropriate measures to ensure that the \ninterests of the State, MSEB and electricity consumers of the State of \nMaharashtra are properly and adequately considered, evaluated and \nsafeguarded,\" according to the terms of reference laid down when forming the \ncommittee. \nThe committee originally consisted of Dr Madhav Godbole, Mr Deepak Parekh, Dr \nE.A.S.

All Rights Reserved. \n\n\nThe Smart Investor\nTertiary will be primary\nIndira Vergis\n\n05/14/2001\nBusiness Standard\n2\nCopyright (c) Business Standard\n\nThese are volatile times for world business. There are increasing jitters \nthat a slowing US economy could dampen prospects for the global economies. \nMany developing regions, especially in Asia, are bracing themselves for a \nbout of slightly lower growth. \nBut two countries, India and China which together account for about half the \nregion's gross domestic product (GDP_ will still continue to see their GDP \ngrow at six per cent, forecasts the Asian Development Bank.\nMany Indian economists agree with ADB's projections. In fact, they view the \nprediction of a six per cent growth in India's GDP as benign. Nearly 54 per \ncent of India's GDP is delivered by its services sector and a modest \nperformance by this sector, some economists say, will be enough to hold up \nthe GDP at six per cent. There are others who hope that better agricultural \nperformance could prompt the economy to hand in a better scorecard. \nHowever, the Indian industry remains trapped in the doldrums, suffering from \na lack of consumer confidence and investments. Very few economists expect to \nsee signs of recovery sprouting any time soon. \nAn interest rate cut is considered vital by many to energise the sector. And, \nthey argue, there are certain economic indicators that encourage such a move. \nInflation is running at very low levels and the nation's foreign exchange \nreserves are currently high enough to provide a strong defence to the Indian \ncurrency. Surprisingly, our trade balance, which threatened to spiral out of \ncontrol by surging oil prices last year, has been contained. Since then, oil \nprices have retreated and are expected to remain subdued. While a rate cut \nmay go some way in reviving sentiment and activity in the industrial sector, \nstirring up consumer demand will still hinge on a normal monsoon. \nRain, rain, come again \nFor many economists, the prediction of India clinging to its current GDP \nlevel is heavily contingent on a normal spell of monsoon this year. \n\"According to our assessment, we believe the Indian economy will grow by \naround 6.5 per cent this fiscal year,\" says Chetan Ahya, vice president at J \nM Morgan Stanley Securities. \nIn 2000-01, agricultural growth withered under a poor monsoon and a \nsubsequent drought in many parts of the country. For the second year in a \nrow, growth in the sector sank below one per cent. It stood at 0.9 per cent \ncompared with 0.7 per cent the previous year. While agriculture accounts for \nonly 24 per cent of GDP, it remains the most keenly-watched sector by \neconomists. \"The performance of the agricultural sector is important because \nof its linkages to the economy both on the supply side and on the consumption \nside,\" says Mohan Nagarajan, chief economist at Credit Analysis and Research \nLtd (CARE). \"It would lead to a better performance of agro-based industries,\" \nhe adds. \nMore significantly, roughly 60 per cent of Indians still depend on \nagriculture for their livelihood. \"A good crop means that demand for \neverything, from everyday use goods like toothpaste to larger items like \ntractors will pick up,\" says Nagarajan. Economists are hoping that a good \nmonsoon will budge growth in the sector to around 1.5 to 2.5 per cent. \nIn service of the economy \nAnother key sector economists will be watching out for will be services. \nIndia's services sector ranging from finance, insurance, hospitality to \ntransportation and communication slowed its pace in 2000-01. With growth \nweakening by a whole per cent to 8.4 in 2000-01, sluggishness in this \nimportant sector has been blamed for dragging down the overall GDP. Most \neconomists expect the sector to post either relatively flat growth or edge \nslightly higher this year. But, it's performance will be vital to ensure that \noverall GDP holds at six per cent. \"Even if the agriculture and industry \nnumbers fall again but services sees even seven to eight per cent growth, it \nwill be enough to keep the GDP around six per cent,\" says Nagarajan. \nConstruction activity a services component that includes housing, roads and \nother infrastructure projects demonstrated surprisingly good growth of 8.7 \nper cent and is expected to maintain the pace. Road construction is tipped to \nshow increasing levels of activity as work on the ambitious highway linking \nMumbai, Delhi, Chennai and Calcutta intensifies. \nChiming in will be the housing industry, benefiting in recent years from tax \nreliefs and attractive financing schemes, and which have encouraged more \npeople to buy houses. \nAnother segment slated to witness good growth will be IT-enabled services, \nsays Morgan Stanley's Ahya. \"We are emerging as the services workshop of the \nworld,\" he says. IT-enabled services like call centres and data processing, \nthough currently generating tiny revenues, are slated to turn into big money \nspinners in the years ahead. \nThe telecommunications industry will also see improving levels of investment. \n\"The penetration of services is so low, that it has an intrinsic high growth \nrate,\" says Ahya. For a taste of the market, consider this: out of the 100 \nIndians, only one uses the Internet and less than three own a telephone. \nA good home show \nAnd there could be a pleasant surprise in store for industry amid all the \ngloom over its performance. \nAdequate liquidity conditions are spurring expectations of a cut in interest \nrates. Broad money(M3) a gauge of total money available in the economy \nincreased 16.2 per cent in 2000-01 against 14.6 per cent last year. \nWhile the Reserve Bank of India had cut the bank rate in March, the belief is \nthat a further cut of 50 basis points is imminent. The bank rate the rate at \nwhich the central bank lends to commercial banks currently stands at seven \nper cent. Aiding the cause is the inflation data which shows the wholesale \nprice index at a tame 5.84 per cent. With economists betting that oil prices \nwill remain in the $24-28 a barrel range, inflation is not expected to \nexhibit the oil price-inspired gyrations of last year. A cut could coax the \nindustry to step up activity, though admittedly, much would still depend on \nrural demand. \nNeighbours' envy \nAnd while many Asian countries watch with increasing nervousness the impact \nof an American downturn on their economies, India and China can afford to \nremain relatively placid about global developments. That's because they are \nless dependent on the US for their own economic health. That is expected to \nshield them somewhat from being blown off-course like some other Asian \nnations by the ill-wind of an American slump in demand. \nWith exports making up less than 10 per cent of India's GDP, its economy is \nclearly not export-driven. In contrast, nearly 35 per cent of Indonesia's GDP \ncomes from exports, 57 per cent for Thailand, and 50 per cent for the \nPhilippines. \nYet, despite claiming only a small percentage of GDP, India's exports \nremained a bright spot amid some gloomy economic data. Exports raced ahead 20 \nper cent to $44.1 billion in 2000-01. It was the second consecutive year of \ngood exports growth. On the flip side, imports rose, too, during the same \nperiod to Rs $49.1 billion. But non-oil imports, however, declined 15 per \ncent to $34.2 billion. That helped narrow the trade gap to $5.74 billion from \n$12.79 billion the previous year. \nStill, India can ill-afford to ignore completely the risks of an American \nslump in demand. The US is India's largest trading partner and, in 2000-01, a \nquarter of its exports headed to that nation. Besides, by taking in nearly 70 \nper cent of India's software exports, it is also India's most important \nsoftware exports destination. \nBooming software exports accompanied by remittances by Indians living \noverseas have been the primary factors exerting a calming influence on \nIndia's balance of payments of position, especially in times of economic \nturbulence. For example, last year, while a surging oil import bill \nthreatened to rattle the nation's trade gap, inflows from \ninvisibles(including income from software and Indians living abroad) came to \nthe rescue helping India limit its overall current account deficit. \nIt's a sobering realisation that has compelled the National Association of \nSoftware and Service Companies(NASSCOM) to lower its exports forecast to \nbetween $8.5 billion to $9 billion from its previous figure of $9.5 billion. \nEarlier, it had also revised estimates for 2000-01 lower to $6.2 billion from \n$6.3 billion. Still, observers say it isn't a cause for depression. \n\"They are still talking about growth. It is a decline in the growth rate and \nnot an actual downturn itself,\" points out John Band, chief executive \nofficer, ASK-Raymond James and Associates. And remittances look set to \nmaintain their pace as well. \"Most remittances are still from Indians who \nlive in the Middle East, and I don't see any slowdown from this segment,\" \nsays CARE's Nagarajan. Remittances totalled $9.8 billion in the nine months \nto December 2000. Software exports brought in $4.6 billion during the same \nperiod. \nForeign institutions support \nAnother recent 'feel-good' sign has been evident in the stock markets too. \nBetween January and April 2001, eigners poured in Rs 7,368 crore into India's \nequity markets - a phenomenal 15 per cent more than what they invested in the \nwhole of calendar 2000. \nYet, experts aren't reading too much into it. In the past few months, \ninvestors have been fleeing from a shower of profit warnings in the US and \nseeking cover in alternative investments. As they rejuggle their portfolios, \nsome money will inevitably flow into India and other countries, experts say. \nBecause it isn't affected so much by what's happening externally, they see \nIndia as some kind of a safe haven,\" says ASK's Band. \nYet some hesitation \nRecently, gunning for more foreign direct investments (FDI), the government \nopened more sectors for foreign and private participation, including \npharmaceuticals, hotels, banking and astonishingly, even defence. However, \ntempting FDI has always been a vexing issue for India. \nIn 2000-01, FDI did improve slightly, moving 26 per cent higher than the \nprevious year to $2.4 billion. Yet, China a market India is frequently \ncompared with in terms of size and potential attracted 20 times more FDI in \nthe same period. Economists now shrug off FDI as a tool to kick-start \ninvestment in the country. \"It's a pittance and it probably will remain \nstagnant,\" says an economist at a foreign research house. \nThe reasons are not hard to find. Foreigners seeking to invest in India have \nmany fences to cross. Frequent changes in sector policies, chaotic \ninfrastructure facilities and nightmarish bureaucratic redtape have often \nleft foreigners tired and wary of doing business in India. \nThe stress of investing in India is most clearly visible in the recurring \nconcerns that have stubbornly dogged US energy giant Enron's 2,148 MW power \nproject in Dabhol in Maharashtra. After being forced to renegotiate a power \nsupply deal in 1995 after concluding it in 1992, Enron has hit the headlines \nonce again. \nThis time, an almost bankrupt state electricity board (SEB) refuses to pay \nits dues for power received and the state government refuses to honour its \ncommitment to pay in case the SEB defaults.It's led to intense speculation \nthat, after suffering repeated snags for nearly a decade, Enron might simply \npull out of the project altogether. A disturbing turn of events, since, till \nrecently, Enron Corp was the biggest foreign investor in India. \nIt will not be the first time that exasperation will have egged on a foreign \ninvestor to pull out of a project. Earlier, US-based Cogentrix Energy had \nalso walked out of its $1.5 billion 1,000 MW Mangalore power project citing \nendless bureaucratic hurdles. \nAnd there has also been some disappointment over India's much-hyped 300 \nmillion middle class which was supposed to be growing rapidly. Many \ninternational firms, inspired by this figure, had scrambled to set up \noperations to conquer a huge chunk of this market. Now many are struggling to \nbreak even and still learning to adapt to local tastes a key ingredient for \nsuccess. That's why despite all its attempts to open up various sectors, \nIndia still remains a tough sell. \nOutlook \nWith a little help from the rains, India could notch up a growth rate of six \nper cent. Many economists have also pointed out that a reforms-studded budget \ncould also inject some enthusiasm in the patient that is the economy. Strong \nmeasures include plans to reform labour laws and government employment. These \nare expected to boost the economy's development, though in the long run. \nThe recent opening up of various sectors could also revive sentiment, \nalthough whether this will translate into FDI flows is arguable. Still, every \nbit helps. The fact remains that it will have to persist in trying to \naccelerate the pace of growth if its ambitions of turning into an economic \npowerhouse are to be realised. After all, for the second most populous nation \nin the world with one of the biggest markets, its economic power is still \nnowhere near the figure its size suggests.\n\nAcegas shares, potential for growth (Acegas, le potenzialita di crescita del \ntitolo)\n\n05/14/2001\nLa Repubblica\n41\nCopyright (C) 2001 Abstracted from La Repubblica in Italian; Source: World \nReporter (TM)\n\nItalian brokers Rasfin SIM have indicated the potential for growth in the \nshares of Acegas, the former municipal utility of the Italian city of \nTrieste.

And given the fact that his own daughter was cited \nfor underage drinking, isn't that a sign that there's only so much effect \nthat a parent can have on their children's behavior?\" \nFleischer responded brusquely: \"No, I think, frankly, there are some issues \nwhere I think it's very important for you all in the press corps to recognize \nthat he is the president of the United States; he's also a father. And the \npress corps has been very respectful in the past of treating family matters \nwith privacy, and I'm certain that you're going to do so again. I hope so.\" \nFleischer later called Roth to chastise him, telling him his question had \nbeen \"noted in the building.\" \nCompeting to Oversee the Corps \nFormer Mississippi representative Mike Parker, a Democrat-turned-Republican \nwho lost a gubernatorial bid a couple of years back, had been seen as the \npick to be assistant secretary of the Army for civil works, overseeing the \nArmy Corps of Engineers. \nParker, a former undertaker, had support from the barge industry, the various \ncorps constituencies and fellow Mississippian Trent Lott, the majority leader \nof the Senate. \nBut the Pentagon's choice was Lawrence Izzo, recently retired president of \nEnron Engineering and Construction Co. who has been in the mix for several \njobs. Izzo, a West Point grad, had 23 years at the Corps before going to \nEnron, former home of Army secretary-designate Thomas White. \nThe majority leader was said to be most unhappy. The latest word is Parker's \ngetting the job. \nEx-Reporters Move On \nKenneth J. Klein, a former reporter who has worked for 17 years for Florida \nSen. Bob Graham (D), most recently as chief of staff, is joining the Outdoor \nAdvertising Association of America as executive vice president for government \nrelations. \nFormer Washington Post colleague Thomas W. Lippman, a 33-year national, \nforeign and financial reporter and author who became vice president of \ncommunications at the World Wildlife Fund in 1999, is moving next month to be \nmanaging director at communications consulting firm Chlopak, Leonard, \nSchechter & Associates. \nConfirmation Countdown \nStaff writer Michael Grunwald contributed to this report.\n\nhttp://www.washingtonpost.com \n\nCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

(KOGAS).\nCommerce, Industry and Energy Minister Chang Che-shik will be delivering \ncongratulatory remarks on behalf of Prime Minister Lee Han-dong who is \ncurrently on an official trip to the Middle East. There will be a visual \npresentation from Lee during the opening ceremony. \n``We have spent more than a year preparing for this international event which \nis the largest in terms of the number of participants and exhibitors,'' said \nLee Seung-hwan, chairman of the Korean National Organizing Committee. \nLNG 13 is 15 percent larger than the conference and exhibition held in \nAustralia back in 1998 which reflects the growth of the industry, Lee \nexplained, adding that the demand for LNG has been increasing rapidly here in \nKorea. \nA wide range of topics will be presented during the four days of conferences \nand exhibitions, helping to showcase the importance of the LNG industry. \nAmong the numerous papers to be presented at the triennial event are ``Old \nWorld, New World, Tomorrow's World: How LNG Has Changed Since LNG 12'' and \n``The Next Generation of LNG Plants.'' \n``Hosting this meaningful event in Korea will help elevate Korea's image in \nthe international market, particularly with the sheer scale and size of LNG \n13,'' said Kim Myung-kyu, president and CEO of KOGAS and chairman of the \nKorea gas Union. \nThe conference will include paper sessions, workshops, poster sessions and \nfilm presentations while exhibitors will demonstrate their exclusive \ntechnologies for the exploration and production of LNG as well as plant \nconstruction. \nThe official sponsors of LNG 13 are the International Gas Union, the Gas \nTechnology Institute and the International institute of Refrigeration while \nthe major sponsors are Shell Gas and Power, KOGAS, LG-Caltex, SK-Enron, the \nQatari Group, TotalFinaElf, British Petroleum and Exxon Mobile. \nIn addition to the conference and exhibition, there will be a technical visit \nto the Inchon LNG Receiving Terminal in Inchon, about 50 kilometers west of \nSeoul, on Friday.\n\nCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

                "Content": " Jarnold.nsf\n\nJohn,\n\nYou might recall we spoke a few weeks ago about a system with more \nintelligence for out-of-hours trading than just leaving the products on Last \nTrade is Mid.\n\nAttached is a suggestion for how such a system might work. It builds on \nOffset to Last Trade functionality.\n\nThe simplified description is: It tracks two variables: Intensity(Speed) and \nBias (Buy or Sell emphasis).  As Intensity increases, the Spread increases. \nAs Bias increases, the Offset increases.\n\nI'll call later to see what you think of the idea.\n\nDave\n\n \n\nProgram Criteria\n\nThe formula which defines the trading decision-making program will need to \nwork with several criteria/inputs/definitions. These might be:\n\nIntensity (Speed) - The average time between transaction attempts, regardless \nof whether they are buys or sells. Measured as a moving average over the last \n[Intensity Factor] transactions by comparing the timestamp of the transaction \nTibco messages for the Product.\nObviously, the lower the Intensity calculation, the higher the transaction \nflow. Therefore a high Intensity number indicates low transaction flow.\nIntensity Factor - The number of transactions to be included in the moving \naverage Intensity calculation. A possible value for this might be [4].\n#Buys - The number of Buys which have occurred.\n#Sells - The number of Sells which have occured.\nTransaction Count - Could be either #Buys or #Sells (whichever last occured).}\nBuy Offset - The Offset value which will be applied if a Buy occurs.\nSell Offset - The Offset value which will be applied if a Sell occurs.\nOffset Reversion Ratio (ORR)- The amount by which the Buy Offset should be \nreduced if a Sell occurs (or amount Sell Offset should be reduced if a Buy \noccurs). A possible value for this might be [0.3]. If the application of the \nORR results in a reduction of less than 1, then the reduction shall be 1.\nTransaction Reversion Ratio (TRR)- The amount by which #Buys should be \nreduced if a Sell occurs (or amount #Sells should be reduced if a Buy \noccurs). A possible value for this might be [0.3]. If the application of the \nTRR results in a reduction of less than 1, then the reduction shall be equal \nto 1.\nSpread Minimum - The minimum Spread value allowed. A possible value for this \nmight be [0.04]\nSpread Maximum - The maximum Spread value allowed. A possible value for this \nmight be [0.50]\nOffset Minimum - The minimum Offset allowed for both Buys and Sells. A \npossible value for this might be [0].\nOffset Maximum -The maximum offset allowed for both Buys and Sells. A \npossible value for this might be [0.50]\nInitial Offset - The Buy and Sell Offset used when the program is started\nInitial Spread - The Spread used when the program is started\nSpread-Offset Minimum - The minimum amount by which Spread must exceed \nOffset. Prevents a possible arbitrage opportunity for the customer. A \npossible value for this might be [0.01]\nDead Interval - The period of time which must pass before the program will \nrecalculate the above Criteria, if no transactions have taken place during \nthe Dead Interval. A possible value for this might be [240] seconds.\n\nProgram Outputs\n\nThe program should output the following variables as a result of combining \nthe above Criteria in a user-defined Formula:\n\nSpread (integer) - as per current Stack Manager\nOffset (integer) - as per current Stack Manager\nSuspension (boolean) - Whether or not the Product should be suspended. \nNormally \"False\"\n\n\nProgram Interface and Operation Principles\n\nThe user should be provided with a GUI which will allow them to define a \nrelationship among the above Criteria, which will produce and apply the \nOutputs to a particular Product. This relationship would be defined with \nIntensity Formulas and Transaction Formulas. \n\nEvery time a Transaction occurs, or a Dead Interval passes, the Criteria will \nbe recalculated and the user-defined formulas will be reviewed by the \nprogram. If a Dead Interval passes without any transactions taking place, \nthen Intensity = Intensity +240 and #Buys=#Buys-TRR and #Sells=#Sells-TRR and \nBuy Offset = Buy Offset- ORR and Sell Offset = Sell Offset - ORR. \n\nIf the user-defined Formulas (see following) indicate that a change in spread \nshould occur, then if the Offset is zero (in the case of a trade occurring) \nor if no trade has occured (during the passing of a Dead Interval), the \nsystem shall perform a Last Trade is Mid calculation around the last \ntransaction, adjusting the buy and sell prices according to the new Spread \nvalue.\n\nAny adjustment to the Spread shall respect the Spread-Offset Minimum. If a \nreduction in the Spread should violate the Spread-Offset Minimum, then the \nBuy Offset (or Sell Offset, or both as appropriate) shall be reduced \naccordingly. Similarly, if the Offset is increased by a Transaction Formula \nto a level greater than the Spread, the Spread shall be increased to maintain \nthe Spread-Offset Minimum.\n\nGUI/Formulas Example:\n\nConstants\nIntensity Factor: [4]\nDead Interval: [240]\nOffset Reversion Ratio (ORR): [0.3]\nTransaction Reversion Ratio (TRR): [0.3]\nSpread Minimum [0.04]\nSpread Maximum [0.50]\nOffset Minimum [0]\nOffset Maximum [0.49]\nSpread-Offset Minimum [0.01]\n\n         INPUTS           OUTPUTS\nIntensity Formula\nFormula # Intensity   Spread Offset  Suspension\nS1  >220   -0.01 n/a F\nS2  <30   +0.01 n/a F\nS3  <10   +0.02 n/a F\n\nTransaction Formula\nFormula # # Transactions  Spread Offset  Suspension\nV1  <4   n/a -0.01 F\nV2  >3   n/a +0.01 F\nV3  >5   +0.01 +0.02 F\nV4  >10   +0.02 +0.04 F\nV5  >15   +0.04 +0.15 F\nV6  >20   n/a n/a T\n    \nNote that #Transactions would be #Buys or #Sells, as appropriate. Note also \nthat #Buys and #Sells are not intended to be an absolute count, but rather \nare a moving measure of the number of buys or sells which have recently \noccured.\n\nIn this example, all Constants and Formulae are editable by the user through \nthe GUI.\n\n\nSimulation\n\nObviously, if we want to proceed, we will want to conduct several simulations \nto prove concepts and evaluate responsiveness. However, to give some idea of \nhow the above might work when a market starts to run in a particular \ndirection, please see the attached:\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Features\n\nSystem Notifications\n\nThere should be two kinds of notifications for the Robotrader, which will be \nsimilar to Stack Manager Garbage Checks: Warning and Failure levels for both \nOffset and Price. The warning levels will trigger a pager message. The \nFailure levels will trigger a pager message and the product will be \nautomatically suspended. The Price checks will be against prices input by the \ntrader (not relative price movements, but actual price). There should be both \nmaximum and minimum price checks (e.g. gas is trading at $5.50. The \nnotification levels could be $8 at the top end and $2 at the bottom end). \nOffset checks will only be against a maximum value.\n\n\n\n\nDave"

                "Content": " Jarnold.nsf\n\nJohn,\nFollowing up on yesterday, there are two additional considerations. \n\nFirst, with regard to the idea of curtailing gas input at the Topock \nliquefaction plant, the pipeline bottleneck is actually downstream of the \nplant, so that wouldn't help. \n\nSecond, it seems there are more of these \"portable pipeline\" units floating \naround than I thought. Besides the inoperable unit in Amarillo, both Transgas \n(in Massachusetts) and Minnigasco may have at least one. Moreover, PG&E has \none at the end of a long lateral line on its system just south of Sacramento. \nApparently it uses it mostly to augment linepack. The specs of that unit are \nabout 4 times higher than the Amarillo one: it puts out 400,000 cubic \nfeet/hour (about 9.6 mmcf/d or almost one contract) at 150 psi. As I said \nyesterday, these units are the only way that you could get gas into the \npipeline system in California. \n\nThis information I got from Jeff Beale, who runs CH-IV, a small-scale LNG \nconsultant. He said that he'd had some similar calls about LNG, and also that \nhe'd be willing to help Enron source equipment if we were really interested \nin looking further into transporting LNG into California. \n\nAssuming that we could get a few \"portable pipelines\" and some trucks, there \nare five liquefaction plants that could most conveniently supply LNG:\n\nLocation Owner  Liquefaction Capacity (gal/day)  Capacity (mmcf/d) Storage \n(gal) Storage (mmcf)\nTopock, AZ ElPaso/ALT 90,000      7.4   100,000  8.2\nLaPlata, CO Williams 20,000     1.64   100,000  8.2\nSacramento   57,600     4.72   132,000  10.8\nLaBarge, WY Exxon  60,000     4.92      \nEvanston, WY Amoco  95,000     7.8   100,000  8.2\n\nTotals         26.48\n\nWhether these plants have spare LNG to sell us is another question. The \nSacramento plant, which I mentioned yesterday, is supposedly dedicated to \nproviding methane for laboratory purposes. The others may have contracts with \nLNG fleet owners. \n\nI'll check back with you later today about the outcome of your meeting. "

You had 80 persons on the Complete Meeting Package.  However,\nwhen coordinating with Tracey Kozadinos, she ordered and guaranteed 100 box\nlunches @ $5.50 per person surcharge for the golf.  Thus, 80+40=120 - 100\n(box lunches) would leave 20 persons permitted to have lunch in The\nWoodlands Dining Room.  We billed you for the total amount of persons over\nthe 20 permitted in the Woodlands Dining Room.\n* JEFF: Breakout charges were for (2) rooms.  Enron had a guarantee of\n120 attendees.  We allow (1) breakout per 40 attendees.  This particular\nday, (5) breakouts were ordered.  The audio visual in the additional\nbreakouts is based on a-la-carte pricing and is not included in the package.\nOnly av is included in the rooms that are part of the allocation.\n\nJeff, I will see that the adjustments are forwarded to you as soon as\npossible in order to remit for payment.

On October 11th, Richter 8, Motley 5, Fischer 3, Crandall 3.  The reason we have been successful with EOL is because in November of 99 the whole industry felt like they could pick us off.

In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:\n\nProducer/Wellhead Group \nThe current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.\n\nStrategic Asset  Development\nLaura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.\n\nCentral Origination and Mid-Market\nFrank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. \n \n\nThere will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. \n\nPlease join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.\n\nLouise & John"

We've found that trading conditions (in base metals) have been difficult and opportunities have been limited,\" Spice said. \nRothschild would not be taking on any new positions in base metals but would see existing positions on its books through to fruition, according to clients' wishes, he said. \nRothschild is a category 2 (associate broker clearing) member of the London Metal Exchange (LME); the company would maintain its LME membership while existing positions run their course and would review it in due course, Spice said. \nThe move to exit base metals will involve the closure of Rothschild's metals sales desk in New York and a number of redundancies in the London and New York trading, sales and support areas, the company said. \nEmployees were informed of the decision on Thursday afternoon; around 20 Rothschild staff in total would be affected by the move, Spice said. \nThe company's Australian base metals activities would continue as normal, however, he added. \n\"Australia has a very strong franchise and will continue to operate in the base metals market,\" he said. \nThe Rothschild move follows news this week that the Bank of Nova Scotia will scale back its base metals trading desk and that Enron Metals plans to cut around 10 percent of staff as a part of a Europe-wide job cut programme. \nBase metals traders have been struggling in recent months in the face of falling business volumes and sagging metals prices as continuing economic gloom and uncertainty after the September 11 attacks on the United States leave buyers sidelined. \nPRECIOUS METALS STRONG \nSpice stressed, however, that the company's precious metals operations would continue as normal. \n\"We have a very strong position in precious metals which will not be affected in any way,\" he said. \n\"N M Rothschild remains strongly committed to our core business in precious metals and continues to be at the forefront of spot, forward and option bullion markets and a leading member of the London Bullion Market Association,\" the company statement said.\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

It later said it did not need all the power from the 2,184 MW plant, and that it was too expensive. \nBut a local regulatory authority, the Maharashtra State Electricity Commission, said the power company's dispute with the utility fell within its ambit, and that Dabhol could not proceed with the arbitration. This sparked a round of litigation, which is now at a stage where the Bombay High Court must decide whether Dabhol can take the dispute to London. \nIn order to prevent more litigation, Enron obtained an injunction from the Commercial Court in London which restrains the government of Maharashtra, which owns the utility, from also filing a suit in India challenging the international arbitration proceedings. \n\"Over the past few months, the government of Maharashtra and other government entities have taken actions to avoid complying with their contractual obligations,\" Dabhol said in a statement received late on Thursday. \"This has frustrated the rights of international investors that were legally agreed to by the relevant parties several years ago.\" \nGovernment officials were not be reached for comment.\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Glencore had yet to respond to the offer on Thursday, the source said.\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Rates will fall further.\"\nHe said that intra-Asian freight rates had already started to slide from a spike that topped W280 at the start of the week to W260 on Thursday ($17.52 per tonne). \nHe said that transpacific trade, which often serves to tighten up the intra-Asian market, was dead. \n\"The only arbs that are open are gasoline to Singapore from Europe and jet going the other way,\" he said. \"Cargill did 35,000 tonnes from Malacca to UK-Cont on the High Challenge: we're guessing jet.\" \nLondon brokers said Enron had also booked a ship, the Teekay Freighter, to shift 70,000 tonnes of gasoil from Jamnagar, India to Europe. \nBrokers said that the Mideast Gulf trade, which occasionally sucks surplus ships out of Asia, was also quiet. Glencore booked two tankers for 40,000 tonne clean cargoes from Yanbu to East Coast India at W235, down 15 points on week-ago levels. \n\"Long Range trades from the Gulf are quiet,\" said a London broker. \"Nothing's happening so it's difficult to know where rates stand, but basically it's going down.\" \nA panel of brokers from London's Baltic Exchange pegged the naphtha trade on 75,000 tonners from the Gulf to Japan at W189 late on Wednesday, following a fall of eight points from week-ago levels.\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. \t\n\nLOCAL\nDANIA RESIDENTS POKE HOLES IN PIPELINE PLAN\nDavid Fleshler Staff Writer\n\n10/11/2001\nSouth Florida Sun-Sentinel\nBroward Metro\n3B\n(Copyright 2001 by the Sun-Sentinel)\n\nA proposal to build a natural gas pipeline from the Bahamas to Broward County drew harsh reviews Wednesday from an audience in Dania Beach. \nNot a single speaker spoke in favor of the project, although one or two were neutral, during a public workshop held by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission at the I.T. Parker Community Center.\n\"It is totally insane to put a high-pressure natural gas pipeline through such a densely populated area,\" said Susan Epps, of Oakland Park. \"The loss of life and property if there would be an accident would be catastrophic.\" \nThe commission is preparing an environmental impact statement for the project. More workshops will be held once a draft is ready. The process is expected to take several months. \nEnron Corp. of Houston proposed the pipeline as a way to meet the state's growing demand for natural gas, a relatively clean and increasingly popular fuel for power plants. Two other companies have made similar proposals. \nEnron's representatives say construction of the pipeline would do minimal damage to the coral reefs in its path. And it is an extremely safe way to transport natural gas. \nBut few people in the audience saw it that way. \nDan Clark, a member of a Broward County group that monitors the health of coral reefs, said that the company's representatives painted too rosy a picture of the project's impact on coral reefs by claiming that drilling a path under the reefs would leave them unharmed. \n\"What they failed to tell you is that they're going to have to assemble the pipe across the second reef and drag it across the second reef,\" he said. \"At a time when we're losing these habitats, we don't want to lose any more, willingly.\" \nSome speakers questioned the wisdom of bringing in another source of fossil fuels, however clean it may be, rather than putting more effort in conservation and renewable energy. \n\"Why don't we regulate people's use of energy?\" asked Judy Kuchta, of North Beach in Hollywood. \"Why do people have to waste energy playing stupid video games and watching mindless TV?\" \nSeveral speakers worried about the project's effects on John U. Lloyd State Park, a popular beachfront park under which the pipeline would run. \n\"The park simply can't sustain the additional degradation of pipeline construction and operation,\" said Sara Case, speaking for Save Our Shoreline, a Hollywood conservation group. \"The beach is one of Broward County's most important sea turtle nesting areas. Shore birds are attracted to the park. We simply find it difficult to believe that significant environmental damage is not inevitable from this monumental project.\" \nDavid Fleshler can be reached at dfleshler@sun-sentinel.com or 954- 356-4535.\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Six-month-old Kareena lay dying in a=\n Houston hospital, awaiting the commercial  flight that was supposed to bri=\nng her a new liver that would save her  life. Hundreds of miles away at Van=\nderbilt University Medical Center in  Tennessee, Dr. Ravi Chari listened to=\n radio reports about the World Trade  Center and the Pentagon as he removed=\n a donor's liver in preparation for  Kareena's transplant.  Retired  Profes=\nsor Keeps Up With Religion  THE TENNESSEAN--For some reason, it's hard to f=\nind people in Nashville  who know much about religion other than their own.=\n Charles Hambrick has  always been an exception. For 25 years, he taught wo=\nrld religions at Vanderbilt  University. He can still be found at any serio=\nus interfaith study group  in town, no matter how small.  Business  Leaders=\n Shown Metro Schools Need Their Help  THE TENNESSEAN--A school busload of b=\nusiness and community leaders were  impressed recently with Metro's new Max=\nwell Elementary, but they also  got a reality check on its needs. At Maxwel=\nl the gleaming hallways still  smell new and teachers are pleased with spac=\nious, well-lighted classrooms.  But computers are scarce, and many library =\nshelves are still empty. That's  the sort of true-life picture that the Nas=\nhville Area Chamber of Commerce  wants business people and community leader=\ns to understand. New Metro Schools  Director Pedro Garcia joined Mayor Bill=\n Purcell, Vanderbilt Chancellor  Gordon Gee and other leaders for the trip.=\n   Vanderbilt  Physician Writes Book of Personal Essays  THE NASHVILLE BUSI=\nNESS JOURNAL--Nashville physician and philanthropist  Frank Boehm is gettin=\ng personal.

Laughter  Still the Best Medicine  SCIENCE DAILY MAGAZINE--Humans=\n have many ways to express themselves, but  one of the most enjoyable and m=\nysterious is laughter. While scientists  have thoroughly researched many ot=\nher human sounds, such as singing and  talking, remarkably little is known =\nabout the acoustics of laughter. Seeking  to rectify this, Vanderbilt psych=\nology professor Jo-Anne Bachorowski and  Cornell psychology professor Micha=\nel Owren studied 1,024 laughter episodes  from 97 young adults as they watc=\nhed funny video clips from films such  as \"When Harry Met Sally\" and \"Monty=\n Python and the Holy  Grail.\" The surprising results were published in the =\nSeptember issue  of the \"Journal of the Acoustical Society of America.\"  Ne=\nw  Clues to the Location of Visual Consciousness  A new test that measures =\nwhat people see when viewing discordant images  in each eye has produced im=\nportant new clues about the location of the  brain activity underlying visu=\nal consciousness.

The 2/10 spread has moved from 104 to 94.  It may be a good time to move the 3-10 to a cal 2 trade.  Pira just gave their seasonal conference in NY and they are very bullish long term gas.\n\tPira's\n\tforecast\t\tNymex \nCal 2 \t2.45\t\t2.99\nCal 3\t3.00\t\t3.31\t\nCal 4\t3.70\t\t3.40\nCal 5\t4.00\t\t3.48\nCal 6\t4.10\t\t3.57\nCal 7\t4.20\t\t3.66\nCal 8\t4.30\t\t3.75\nCal 9\t3.60\t\t3.84\t\t(TransAlaska Highway Pipeline)\nCal 10\t3.80\t\t3.93\n3-10\t3.84\t\t3.59\n\nRegardless of what you think of Pira and long term price forecasts, the rest of the market does listen.  They have a tremendous amount of respect in the industry and affect how customers and producers hedge.  The flow, which has been buyers over for the way backs, I think will get more pronounced, especially if the front goes down.  \n\nIn the past week, I've sold Duke 40,000/d Cal 6-10 and 25,000/d Cal 7-10.  I've sold PGE maybe 30,000 day Cal 4-5.  The only seller has been El Paso whom I believe is hedging production.  He is trying to pressure the y/y spreads as a spec trade that I think was/is being done to front run the corp hedges.  I've used it as an opportunity to put a lot of spreads away for inventory down the road.  If you want to buy this strip back in the next 6 months, I think it's going to be much easier/cheaper to roll it closer.  "

It's hard to say exactly what the upward impetus is,=\n but analysts have mentioned the positive guidance by tech companies such a=\ns Cisco and others and a possible relief rally as occurred after previous m=\nilitary actions, and the notion that after months of declines and a dip due=\n to the attacks of 9/11, stocks are well oversold.  Still, the gains so far=\n have been tenuous, and downward pressure remains in the form of investor f=\nears about the cost and duration of the war against terrorism in light of t=\nhe weekend's attacks on Afghanistan and renewed threats of terrorist retali=\nation.  Added to existing concerns as Wall Street faces what could be the w=\norst earnings season in what has been a very bleak year, and it's hard to s=\npeculate where we may end up.  - - - - - MORE Breaking News  [IMAGE] [IMAGE=\n]    [IMAGE]=09[IMAGE]=09\n\n\n =09    [IMAGE]  Today's Feature - Monday     Do you need Insurance?

But  industry experts say the company's woes run deeper, involving management  missteps that could occur at any corporation as well as troubles rooted in the  economics, politics and culture of Europe.http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/whatshot.cfm \nFinance and Investment\nA New Approach to Valuing Biotech Stocks\nNow  that the U.S. faces a bioterrorist attack in the shape of anthrax, stocks of  biotechnology companies are soaring. But while these companies have promising  technologies, they are years away from profits. The boomlet shows, however, how  hard it is to value biotech stocks. Analysts often use proxy drivers such as the  number of patents or the dollar value of partnerships to value such companies,  but these drivers fail to show if the companies will be able to turn their  research into marketable products. Research by Karl Ulrich, a Wharton professor  of operations and information management, and other colleagues offers insights  into a new approach to value biotech companies. Hint: Look at how the company's  drug discovery process is organized.http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/articles.cfm?catid=1&articleid=454 \nFinance and Investment\nJames J. Cramer Finds Truth and Inspiration in the Shopping Habits  of Americans\nWhen James J. Cramer, co-founder of Smart Money  and TheStreet.com and analyst on CNBC, wants to know where the U.S. economy is  headed, he looks at the performance of major retailers. That, and his  observations on everything from gasoline to telecom to Winston Churchill, formed  the basis for an optimistic economic outlook he recently shared with  participants at the Wharton Investment Management Conference.http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/articles.cfm?catid=1&articleid=456 \nFinance and Investment\nShould Hong Kong Worry When China Joins the  WTO?\nAs Frederick Lau sees it, what's good for China is good  for Hong Kong.

They cite a  number of reasons for the unraveling of the industry, and point to Europe and  Asia as the real leaders in telecom.http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/articles.cfm?catid=14&articleid=451 \nFinance and Investment\nCitigroup CFO Sees Economic Recovery in  Mid-2002\n\"It is going to be a very, very tough next couple of  quarters,\" is how Todd S. Thomas, CFO of Citigroup, described the near-term  economic outlook to an audience at the Wharton Finance Conference on Oct. 12.  But longer-term, Thomson was more optimistic, predicting that increased  government spending and/or tax cuts would stimulate a recovery.

But even as they  search for new ways to generate revenue and conserve capital, CFOs from a  variety of industries are discovering the value of one strategy --  sale-leasebacks -- that for many years was primarily focused on real estate  transactions. Sale-leasebacks are generally structured to unlock the equity a  business has in its assets (like machinery and equipment), converting that  equity into cash.http://www.gecfo.com/resources/wharton.html?c=Wharton&n=September&t=email \nGE Capital:\nMaximizing Your Trucking Fleet in Tough  Times\nTough times have hit the trucking industry as shippers  evaluate the best way to move goods around the country: Lease or buy?

The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where \"name\" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname).

It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.\n\nTo determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any \"spaces\" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com.

The current environment could also make financing such a transaction quite difficult, and board approval isn't a certainty. However, should the two sides agree to terms, a deal could be announced in the next few days. Northwest Natural is also expected to assume roughly $1 billion in debt.\nEnron and Northwest Natural declined to comment. \nIf a transaction is consummated, it would come nearly six months after the collapse of Enron's agreement to sell the utility to Sierra Pacific Resources. That transaction fell apart in part because of the California energy crisis. \nA purchase of Portland General would be a very big bite for Northwest Natural, which has a market capitalization of just $650 million and supplies natural gas to more than 500,000 residential and business customers in Oregon and Vancouver, Wash. Portland General is an electric utility serving more than 1.4 million customers in Oregon. \nThe deal would bring together two Oregon utilities whose executives and employees know each other well. Richard G. Reiten, Northwest's chairman and chief executive, was president and chief operating officer of Portland General between 1989 and 1996, and also served on its board. \nBy buying a utility, Northwest would hope to have more bargaining power in its gas purchases, enabling it to buy more product and store it when prices are cheap. A deal would be accretive to Northwest's earnings, people familiar with the matter say. And the financial risk for Northwest Natural is somewhat muted because Enron is helping to facilitate and finance the transaction by agreeing to take common stock and convertible preferred stock in Northwest Natural in addition to cash. Northwest Natural would finance the transaction with debt and equity offerings. \nShares of Northwest Natural were trading up $1.04 at $25.99 in 4 p.m. composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, while Enron stock was down 39 cents a share at $33.10. \nFor Enron, a deal with Northwest Natural would be the latest twist in a five-year ordeal that was supposed to help the nation's biggest energy trader break into California's deregulating electricity market. But the utility business proved less valuable than anticipated when Enron was prevented from selling off utility contracts that enabled it to buy electricity cheaply. And California's market developed serious problems last year that made it a less attractive place for Enron to do business. \nEnron, which also owns a major gas-transmission pipeline system, has a history of buying assets and businesses, learning what it can from them, and then selling off the bulk of physical assets so it can reinvest capital elsewhere. \nIt isn't clear where Enron will put the capital to work that it garners from the sale. Its broadband telecommunications business is in the doldrums and it recently said it would invest $250 million in it this year, down from a formerly projected $750 million.\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The current environment could also make financing such a transaction quite difficult, and board approval isn't a certainty. However, should the two sides agree to terms, a deal could be announced in the next few days. Northwest Natural (NWN) is also expected to assume roughly $1 billion in debt.\nEnron (ENE) and Northwest Natural declined to comment. \nIf a transaction is consummated, it would come nearly six months after the collapse of Enron's agreement to sell the utility to Sierra Pacific Resources. That transaction fell apart in part because of the California energy crisis. \nA purchase of Portland General would be a very big bite for Northwest Natural, which has a market capitalization of just $650 million and supplies natural gas to more than 500,000 residential and business customers in Oregon and Vancouver, Wash. Portland General is an electric utility serving more than 1.4 million customers in Oregon. \nThe deal would bring together two Oregon utilities whose executives and employees know each other well. Richard G. Reiten, Northwest's chairman and chief executive, was president and chief operating officer of Portland General between 1989 and 1996, and also served on its board. \nBy buying a utility, Northwest would hope to have more bargaining power in its gas purchases, enabling it to buy more product and store it when prices are cheap. A deal would be accretive to Northwest's earnings, people familiar with the matter say. And the financial risk for Northwest Natural is somewhat muted because Enron is helping to facilitate and finance the transaction by agreeing to take common stock and convertible preferred stock in Northwest Natural in addition to cash. Northwest Natural would finance the transaction with debt and equity offerings. \nFor Enron, a deal with Northwest Natural would be the latest twist in a five-year ordeal that was supposed to help the nation's biggest energy trader break into California's deregulating electricity market. But the utility business proved less valuable than anticipated when Enron was prevented from selling off utility contracts that enabled it to buy electricity cheaply. And California's market developed serious problems last year that made it a less attractive place for Enron to do business. \nShares of Northwest Natural were trading up $1.04 at $25.99 in 4 p.m. composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, while Enron stock was down 39 cents a share at $33.10. \nCopyright (c) 2001 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. \nAll Rights Reserved.\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Enron is one of the partners in the in the joint venture oil property along \nwith Reliance Industries and \nOil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC). \n\\\"Even before the deal was clinched, all the three joint venture partners i.e., ONGC, Reliance and Enron had entered into an agreement according to which, if the operator company quits the \njoint venture, the first right of refusal lies with the other two partners. \nTherefore, the option of becoming operator in the oil property is with the remaining two partners in the joint venture,\\\" Mr Naik said. \nBritish Gas India CEO Nigel Shaw told The Financial Express that the company would not accept anything short of full operatorship right. On being asked whether rotatory operatorship would be acceptable to the company, he said, \\\"No. It is too messy.\\\" \nMr Shaw had stated on Wednesday that the deal with Enron, to be transacted by October end, would fall through if it was not given the operatorship of these oil and gas field. \nMr Naik said that ONGC, which holds a 40-per cent stake in these fields had staked its claims in these fields much before the deal was sealed between Enron and British Gas. \nAsked on the role of the government in the controversy, Mr Naik said that the Centre will act as a facilitator to help the joint venture companies reach an agreement.\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Indian institutions have an exposure of over Rs 6,000 crore to the 2,184 mega watt project. \nIndian lenders have said that the dispute between all the stakeholders should be resolved before the sale of foreign equity. They have also suggested that the new promoter be provided relief like lowering the interest rate on borrowings, according DPC mega power project status and tax concessions. IDBI chairman PP Vora said after the three-hour long meeting that the lenders have been asked to explore alternatives and revert to the Centre after three weeks. Sources said that during the period, Indian lenders would prepare the roadmap for revival of the project. Negotiations with other possible suitors would also be initiated, they added. \nThe institutions have said that the sale of equity be directly negotiated between Enron and the prospective buyers. While BSES has finally decided not to go ahead with its plans to take over DPC, National Thermal Power Corporation has said the project was not economically viable for it. Akin to Godbole Committee recommendations, the institutions have also recommended conversion of dollar-denominated debt to rupee loans to prevent tariff escalation. With DPC having already initiated arbitration proceedings against Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB), the Indian lenders would also look at the legality of sale while the issue was sub-judice. \nToday's meeting, convened by finance secretary Ajit Kumar, was attended by power secretary A K Basu, Vora and other senior executives from IDBI, ICICI, IDFC and State Bank of India apart from government officials.\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

A time-frame is being talked about in this connection, wherein no other party would be talked to and discussions would take place only between the two sides. \nIndustry sources said the Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI), which is acting as a major facilitator to the stake sale, is a key player in the agreement between Tata Power and Enron. Discussions on the sale of the equity would directly take place between Tata Power and Enron, the sources said.\nTata Power managing director Adi Engineer confirmed his meeting with the Enron India managing director K Wade Cline in the presence of IDBI chairman PP Vora on Thursday. \"We have had a preliminary meeting where both the parties were apprised of the situation. We will have to wait for further developments,\" he added. \nAccording to sources, a time-bound agreement between Enron and Tata Power would provide an easy access to the various deals which Enron had struck at the time of commencment of work on the 2,184 mw Dabhol project. Tata Power would have to look into over 500 documents related to the Dabhol project and do the due deligence before giving a concrete offer to Enron. \nTata Power, in a bid to expand its presence across the state, is also keen to hold hard, bargaining over the \"acceptable\" tariff of the project which would have to be restructured. Investment banking major JM Morgan Stanley, which is understood to be advising the Tatas on the deal, has already swung into action and has started collecting necessary back-up information from various sources including the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, for Tata Power. \nWhile no comment was available from Enron on the issue, financial institution sources said: \"Tata Power is interested in talks. It is a good thing if things work out between the two sides.\" JM Morgan boss Nimesh Kampani had no comments to offer to The Financial Express when asked about the developments. \nThe FIs, led by IDBI, had been keen that they would play the role of facilitator in the sale of the Enron stake in DPC, since huge sums of money are stuck in the project for the borrowers. While even BSES Ltd was being mentioned earlier as one of the contenders, the company does not seem inclined to proceed with it now. That leaves Tata Power as the chief contender for the stake sale. \nThe FIs are also expected to play a role in roping in a partner for the LNG facility which is to be hived off. The names of some of the gas majors like British Gas, BP, Shell, Reliance in addition to the state-run Gas Authority of India (Gail) are being mentioned as potential partners in this connection, the sources said. The FIs are clear that any discussion on the LNG facility will have to include the new sponsor of the project.\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

I have always been impressed by this winery and the Reserva Chianti is amoung the best ever produced. The Riserva is 100% Sangiovese, from the oldest vines, with the best exposure. Vinfied in barrel, this silky, explosively aromatic Chianti is the best wine Corzano e Paterno has ever produced. Aljosha feels it best represents the wonderful vineyards of Corzano e Paterno. \"Gary V - Wine Library Have your own tasting notes?

It really typifies one of Babcock's favorite themes in winemaking-- the integration of amplitude and balance. In contrast to the 1997 Black Label Cuvee, this wine is a little more compact, achieving the same riveting intensity, but at a lower finished alcohol. The result-- a concentrated, teeth-staining wine, with elegance. Parker has now put this wine on the map,and Babcock has taken it to even a higher level with this massive effort !

The 2000 version of this Dolcetto is a very explosive wine and an outstanding value. The dark fruit and complexity on both the finish and the mid-palate is very exciting.

Michelle and its sister winery, Columbia Crest, have been fine-tuning their approaches to Syrah since 1995, and plans are to dive into production of this varietal in a big way. A ripe 1998 vintage produced a gorgeous example of what's possible in Washington with Syrah. This wine is rich and fragrant, a supple and yummy mouthful of plum, blackberry and cherry fruit that mingles on the creamy finish with hints of vanilla and exotic spices. It's beautifully made, and packed with enough flavor to develop with cellaring. Drink now through 2008. \"Have your own tasting notes?

                "Content": " JARNOLD (Non-Privileged).pst\n\n\nToday, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.\n\nWe made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.\n\nOver the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.\n\nFollowing are the highlights of our businesses:\n\nWholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).\nAmericas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).\nEurope and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.\n\nRetail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.\n\n\nTransportation and Distribution:\n\tNatural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.\nPortland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year.\nGlobal Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.\n\nBroadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.\n\nCorporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.\n\nIn addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include:\n?\tA $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp.\n?\t$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.\n?\t$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.  \n\nWith our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

As a result of the reduction, Enron's shareholder equity dropped to 9.5 bln usd, the company said. \nIn an interview, Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay said about 35 mln usd of the 1.01 bln usd charge to earnings was related to transactions with LJM2 Co-Investment LP, a limited partnership created and run by Fastow. \nIn a conference call yesterday with investors, Lay said 55 mln shares had been repurchased by Enron, as the company \"unwound\" its participation in the transactions. In the third quarter, the company's average number of shares outstanding was 913 mln. \nAccording to Rick Causey, Enron's chief accounting officer, these shares were contributed to a \"structured finance vehicle\" set up about two years ago in which Enron and LJM2 were the only investors. In exchange for the stock, the entity provided Enron with a note. \nThe aim of the transaction was to provide hedges against fluctuating values in some of Enron's broadband telecommunications and other technology investments. Causey did not elaborate on what form those hedges took. \nSubsequently, both the value of Enron's stock and the value of the broadband investments hedged by the entity dropped sharply, the report said. As a result, Enron decided essentially to dissolve the financing vehicle and reacquire the shares. When Enron reacquired the shares, it also canceled the note it had received from the entity. \nGiven all the complexities of the LJM-related financing vehicle and the questions it raised outside the company, \"the confusion factor wasn't worth the trouble of trying to continue this,\" Causey said. \nMark Palmer, an Enron spokesman, described the capital reduction \"as just a balance-sheet issue\" and therefore was not deemed \"material\" for disclosure purposes. \ngc For more information and to contact AFX: www.afxnews.com and www.afxpress.com\n\n\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The construction cost will be $350-$450 million for the combined-cycle project, which will undergo a 12-month review process by the commission. \nGWF Energy LLC has applied to build the 169-MW Tracy Peaker Project, a simple cycle plant in the San Joaquin Valley, Calif., that would be online by July 2002. Peaker plants operate during times of high electricity demand. \nThe company also applied to build the 91-MW Henrietta Peaker Project, 20 miles south of Hanford, Calif., which would consist of two turbine generators and come on line by June 2002. \nElectricity generated from the two peaker projects will be sold to the state's Department of Water Resources under a 10-year contract. \n-By Jessica Berthold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3872; jessica.berthold@dowjones.com\n\n\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

This is an extremely widely held stock and to assume that everybody listened to the conference call is probably asking too much,\" said one analyst who asked not to be identified. \nThe reduction in equity was prominently reported in the Wall Street journal on Thursday, bringing it to the attention of a wider audience, analysts said. \nLay said the equity writedown and a corresponding reduction in the number of Enron shares outstanding were related to the early termination of structured finance arrangements which had drawn criticism from some Wall Street analysts. \nAs a result of the operation, Enron's debt to total capitalization ratio will rise to about 50 percent, but the company expects the proceeds of asset sales to reduce the ratio to around 40 percent by the end of next year, Lay said. \nMoody's Investor Service said earlier this week that it had placed all of Enron's long-term debt obligations on review for a possible downgrade because writedowns and charges had substantially reduced valuations for several Enron businesses. \nSome of Enron's financing arrangements require the company to maintain investment grade credit ratings.\n\n\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

With wide-ranging commodity positions from lumber to pulp to bandwidth, oil and natural gas, its strategy hinges on the ability to transfer those products from buyer to seller more cheaply and quickly than its competitors. \nFor the power market, that means Enron needs easy access to electric transmission lines, the interstate highway system that allows it to wheel supplies between regions and capitalize on short-term price imbalances. \nUTILITIES BLOCK COMPETITION \nEnron's big problem? Traditional utilities own transmission lines and have shaped the rules to block new entrants and favor their own generation, Shapiro said. \n\"Vertically integrated monopolies have been very effective in delaying wholesale competition across the board,\" he said. \nIn its pleas to Supreme Court justices and regulators, Enron has tried to empower federal regulators to force utilities to open their wires to competition. \nThe Supreme Court last week heard oral arguments in a case that could be a watershed for the U.S. power industry and decide whether FERC has the right to drive competition on state transmission networks. \nIn a classic battle of state versus federal jurisdictional turf, Enron wants the court to give FERC more authority to compel states to open their transmission grids to competitors. \nMeanwhile, New York has brought a companion case that says FERC has gone too far and the court should give control of transmission wires back to the states. \n\"This is an example of an agency that has overstepped its bounds,\" Lawrence Malone, general counsel for the New York State Public Service Commission, said at the oral argument. \nNew York wants the court to revoke FERC's authority to regulate retail sales, contending electricity involved in such sales stays within state boundaries and is not subject to federal legislation. \n\"I think a victory for New York would be absolutely disastrous for consumers across the country,\" Shapiro said. \n\"FERC has jurisdiction. All they need to do is exercise it,\" Shapiro said, echoing Enron lawyers' case to Supreme Court justices that existing laws give FERC the power to do Enron's will. \nEnron does not see a recent congressional push for energy legislation as key to its plans, Shapiro said. \"FERC is doing its job on the electricity front. I'm not sure that legislation is required on that front.\" \nFERC SHOWS PROMISING SIGNS \nWith new Chairman Pat Wood at the helm, FERC is moving in the right direction to drive competition, Shapiro said. \"It's early in his tenure,\" Shapiro said of Wood. \"Many of the signs are promising.\" \nWood has made so-called regional transmission organizations a high priority and set aggressive agency rules to drive utilities to join them. \nRTOs establish common rules that allow utilities to smoothly trade bulk electricity across the borders of their own local transmission systems. Enron sees RTOs as a positive step toward competition. \nIn what he called a \"carrots and sticks\" approach, Wood signaled in late September that utilities must either join RTOs or face losing the right to sell power in wholesale markets. \nFERC will hold a week-long meeting on RTOs beginning Monday. \nEnron is skeptical that carrots are useful, and is a bigger fan of sticks, Shapiro said. \nUtilities have \"gotten quite fat over the last nine or 10 years,\" Shapiro said, and will shrug off FERC's incentives. \"I'm not sure there are a sufficient number of carrots in the world right now to incentivize these companies,\" Shapiro said.\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Up to 30 companies participated in the French market. \n\"Utilities from across the continent are trading the French market,\" said Baeumerich. \nMuch of the trading took place on France's borders with neighbouring countries, he said.\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Another $450 million will be replaced by a junk\nbond of the same size, the bankers said.\n\n     Merrill, which advised Northwest on its acquisition, will\nmanage the bond sale. Credit Suisse advised Enron Corp. on the\nsale of Portland for $2.9 billion in cash, stock and assumed debt\nto Northwest.\n\n     Portland, Oregon-based Northwest also plans to issue $150\nmillion of common equity once the acquisition is closed, according\nto Chief Executive Richard Reiten.

However, they'll have to pay for services,\" Gross said. \n\"You could see a situation where dealers specialise in different areas - certain dealers would provide credit functions, certain institutions would provide clearing, others would provide execution and certain companies would provide market-making.\" \nDIFFICULT CONDITIONS \nDifficult market conditions are already forcing metals traders to rethink their activities; this week alone has seen N.M. Rothschild & Sons exit base metals trading and both Bank of Nova Scotia and Enron looking to scale back. \n\"On the LME now you've got low volumes, falling volatilities, falling prices and we're in the grips of a bear market. It's very, very poor for business in general,\" Gross said. \n\"There are too many dealers around chasing a shrinking amount of business...Each company is going to have to look very carefully at their business and their staffing levels.\" \nSpectron has not been immune from declining volumes. \n\"Our volumes for the first 12 months of operation were fantastic, way beyond what we had expected. However, our volumes have fallen in the recent quarter,\" Gross said. \n\"That's due to two factors: first, the overall market activity is lower, and second LME Select has managed to attract some of the business that we would previously have had 100 percent of.\" \nThe company is now looking at ways to further develop its trading platform. \n\"We're beginning to investigate ways to add certain features and do things differently. That might involve creating an alternative platform where clients could access prices and thereby widen the service,\" Gross said. \nBut, he stressed, \"we have to keep the interests of our dealer clients foremost.\" \nUNCERTAINTY \nIn the current environment, the LME's refusal to throw its weight behind either open-outcry floor trade or its new screen system - the exchange has taken pains not to express any preference and to \"allow the market to decide\" - may prove to be counterproductive, Gross said. \n\"By having two systems running side by side ... the exchange is almost moving in two totally different directions,\" he said. \n\"There's a feeling that the ring is doomed, which doesn't do anything to encourage its use, while the reluctance to fully back electronic trading means that you're still only seeing a trickle of business going through Select in terms of overall volumes.\" \nWhile preferences vary in different sectors of the market, the current uncertainty is helping no-one, he said: \n\"Metals traders just want to trade. They just want to know with some kind of certainty how the market will be structured in future so they can structure their business to support that and make money.\"\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

But in the wake of post-agree=\nment disclosures by Enron that its future earnings are likely to be substan=\ntially less than expected, the company's stock has been hammered. In 1 p.m.=\n trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday, Enron shares fell 30 cen=\nts to $4.71. The stock is down 94% so far this year and far short of the pe=\nr-share takeover price. Dynegy shares rose 64 cents to $40.40.\nAlthough Dynegy and Enron both say they are going ahead with the deal under=\n the terms negotiated, Dynegy does appear to have other options. The agreem=\nent with Enron contains a broad \"material adverse change\" clause as well as=\n some specific trigger points that could be invoked.=20\nDynegy officials performed \"due diligence\" throughout the holiday weekend, =\nseeking to learn more about the intimate workings of Enron, which has suffe=\nred a series of damaging blows. Since mid-October, Enron has disclosed that=\n some of its officers participated in personally enriching deals that moved=\n assets off Enron's balance sheet, for a time, to several private partnersh=\nips. Those deals are now the subject of a Securities and Exchange Commissio=\nn investigation. Past treatment of some of those deals has been termed an \"=\naccounting error\" by Enron and it twice has rejiggered its earnings since O=\nct. 16. At one point, Enron restated downwards nearly five years of earning=\ns.=20\nAn Enron spokeswoman said the company was proceeding in the belief that the=\n deal would be completed as agreed. Dynegy spokesman John Sousa said the tw=\no sides are forging ahead although he acknowledged that the walk-away provi=\nsions \"are broad, by design, to ensure adequate protection for Dynegy share=\nholders.\" Shareholders of both firms must still vote on the merger agreemen=\nt.=20\nClauses related to a \"material adverse change,\" also known as a \"material a=\ndverse effect,\" have been the focus of much attention among merger professi=\nonals this year, due, in part, to the stock market's fluctuations and the e=\nconomic slowdown that have caused some buyers to reconsider planned acquisi=\ntions.=20\nBut such clauses rarely are invoked by a buyer or seller because they are c=\nonsidered extremely difficult to prove. Both parties typically are reluctan=\nt to lay out specific terms for canceling a deal, much the way a bride and =\ngroom often balk at negotiating a prenuptial agreement since it appears to =\nenvisage a breakup of the marriage even before it begins.=20\nFurthermore, a key court case earlier this year affirmed widespread views t=\nhat a buyer can't easily walk away from a merger. In that case, meat-proces=\nsing concern Tyson Foods Inc. sought to cancel a planned acquisition of mea=\nt-packer IBP Inc. due to a drop in IBP's earnings and a write-down of an IB=\nP subsidiary. But a Delaware judge refused to let Tyson cancel the pact, sa=\nying Tyson had been aware of the cyclical nature of IBP's business and the =\naccounting issue.=20\nIn a lengthy June 18 opinion, Delaware Chancery Court Vice Chancellor Leo E=\n. Strine Jr. wrote that \" . . . the important thing is whether the company =\nhas suffered a Material Adverse Effect in its business or results of operat=\nions that is consequential to the company's earnings power over a commercia=\nlly reasonable period, which one would think would be measured in years rat=\nher than months.\"=20\nThat interpretation has created ripples in the deal-making community, promp=\nting some transactions to include more details about circumstances under wh=\nich deals can be terminated. Since the Sept. 11 attacks, for example, a han=\ndful of merger agreements have specified that future terrorist activity wou=\nld qualify as a \"material adverse change,\" or MAC.=20\nA key issue for any firm alleging there has been a material adverse change =\nis \"whether the new facts go to the guts of the strategic opportunity or is=\n it just a hiccup,\" says Meredith Brown, co-chairman of the mergers and acq=\nuisitions group at law firm Debevoise & Plimpton in New York. He adds that =\na court \"may be skeptical\" if Dynegy claimed that Enron's post-merger agree=\nment disclosures were a surprise.=20\nThe Enron-Dynegy merger agreement includes several triggers permitting eith=\ner side to seek termination. Enron can quit the deal if it receives a subst=\nantially better offer, although it is prohibited from soliciting one. In su=\nch a case, it could be required to pay a $350 million \"topper fee\" to Dyneg=\ny and its co-investor, ChevronTexaco Inc.=20\nDynegy can alter the deal if Enron faces \"pending or threatened\" litigation=\n liabilities that are \"reasonably likely\" to cost Enron $2 billion. If thos=\ne liabilities hit $3.5 billion \"an Enron material event will be deemed to h=\nave occurred,\" presumably allowing Dynegy to call the whole thing off. In s=\nome situations, Dynegy would be liable for a $350 million fee, as well.=20\nKaren Denne, the Enron spokeswoman, said her firm doesn't believe that loss=\nes arising from the normal course of business would qualify as a material e=\nvent. The liability must result from litigation. Currently, the company fac=\nes more than a dozen shareholder suits alleging breach of fiduciary duty by=\n officers and directors, issuing false and misleading reports and other off=\nenses.=20\nDeal makers who aren't involved in the combination say the steep drop in En=\nron's stock price since the merger agreement was signed wouldn't by itself =\ngive Dynegy the ability to cancel the pact or force Enron to renegotiate it=\ns terms. Instead, they say, Dynegy would likely have to prove that Enron's =\nworsening financial condition was an unanticipated event, which could be di=\nfficult in light of the company's highly publicized problems and Dynegy's f=\nrequent statement that it clearly understands Enron's businesses. Still, th=\nere is another standard clause in the merger document that would allow Dyne=\ngy to terminate the deal if \"any representation or warranty of Enron shall =\nhave become untrue.\"=20\nOther energy companies have abandoned deals following a widening gap in sto=\nck prices that changed an acquisition premium. Western Resources Inc. of To=\npeka, Kansas last week sued Public Service Co. of New Mexico seeking hundre=\nds of millions of dollars in damages after it failed to buy Western's utili=\nties. The lawsuit accused Public Service of breaching its \"duty of good fai=\nth and fair dealing\" and said the New Mexico company tried to \"sabotage\" th=\ne deal as the two companies' stock prices diverged. Public Service denies t=\nhe accusations.\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Despite a $35 billion merger completed in Octobe=\nr, ChevronTexaco Corp. is still not one of the oil superpowers. Nor, at mor=\ne than $90 billion a year in revenues, is it a scrappy little guy. So Chair=\nman David J. O'Reilly has been searching for a strategy beyond just drillin=\ng for more oil and gas.=20\nNow, he may have something: a big stake in the No. 1 energy-trading company=\n. Chevron Corp. has owned 26% of Dynegy Inc. since 1996, and with Dynegy's =\nplanned acquisition of Enron Corp., the top energy trader, ChevronTexaco is=\n making the oil industry's most aggressive push yet into this fast-growing =\nbusiness. It plans to eventually pump $2.5 billion into the combined Dynegy=\n and Enron to maintain its 26% stake, and it might raise that share. So, wh=\nile ChevronTexaco's much bigger rivals run small in-house trading operation=\ns, energy trading may soon account for more than 10% of ChevronTexaco's ear=\nnings. ``Chevron is now positioned to be a leader in the business,'' says a=\nnalyst Arjun Murti at Goldman, Sachs & Co.\nThe deal would certainly dovetail with ChevronTexaco's strategy of becoming=\n a more integrated energy company, with a hand in everything from pumping o=\nil at the wellhead to trading natural-gas futures. By acquiring Texaco, Che=\nvron picked up, for instance, a big refining-and-marketing business --which=\n should balance out the bad times in oil and gas production, says Eugene No=\nwak, an analyst at ABN Amro. ``When crude-oil prices are down, they'll have=\n margin improvements on refining and marketing,'' he says. O'Reilly and oth=\ner ChevronTexaco executives declined to comment.=20\nUntil now, Dynegy wasn't a big deal for Chevron. Chevron purchased the stak=\ne for $700 million when Dynegy was still called NGC Corp., and it filled th=\nree of the 14 board seats--positions it will keep. Since then, Chevron has =\nsold nearly all its domestic natural-gas production to Dynegy. The stake ha=\ns been a good investment: it is now worth $3 billion, ChevronTexaco says.=\n=20\nSitting on $2.9 billion in cash as of the end of the second quarter, Chevro=\nnTexaco can well afford the Dynegy deal, analysts say. And they expect O'Re=\nilly to use some of that to make more buys; the most likely target is a nat=\nural-gas company. Maybe it's not so bad being No. 4.\n\nIllustration: Chart: CHEVRON'S GROWING CASH HOARD=20\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

CEO Charles L. Watson if he had sat=\n back and gloated. After all, Watson had watched as his bigger, brasher cro=\nsstown rival sniffed at Dynegy's more cautious strategy, all the while garn=\nering most of the credit for reshaping the energy-trading business.=20\nInstead, Watson picked up the phone on Oct. 24 and called Enron Chairman, C=\nEO, and longtime acquaintance Kenneth L. Lay to ask how he could help. Lay =\ndidn't respond immediately, but as Enron's stock continued to plunge and th=\ne company faced a cash squeeze, it became clear what the only realistic ans=\nwer could be: Bail us out.\nSo two days later, Lay invited Watson to his River Oaks home near downtown =\nHouston for breakfast to discuss a deal. Over muffins and ``a bad cup of co=\nffee'' the next day, Watson recalls, they sketched the outlines, and by 10 =\np.m. that night, the investment bankers were called in. On Nov. 9, Dynegy a=\nnnounced that it would pay about $10 billion, plus the assumption of $13 bi=\nllion in debt, to buy Enron, which is nearly four times its size. The key t=\no the deal was Dynegy's immediate $1.5 billion infusion of cash to shore up=\n Enron's balance sheet and save its credit rating. The money came from Dyne=\ngy's 26% owner, ChevronTexaco Corp.=20\nWithout that help, Enron--the seventh-largest U.S. company, based on its $1=\n00 billion in sales last year--may well have faced bankruptcy. Watson says =\nthat he never would have imagined such an outcome in his wildest dreams. ``=\nI don't think anybody foresaw the problems [at Enron],'' he says. ``It's be=\nen incredible to watch.''=20\nWatson, 51, has to make good on what may well be his riskiest investment ye=\nt. If he can pull it off, the new Dynegy will have revenues of more than $2=\n00 billion and $90 billion in assets, including more than 22,000 megawatts =\nof power-generating capacity and 25,000 miles of pipeline. It would control=\n an estimated 20% to 25% of the energy-trading market, up from about 6% now=\n.=20\nThat would be sweet vindication for Watson's strategy. Dynegy backs trading=\n operations with hard assets such as power plants, which allows the company=\n to guarantee a supply of electricity to a buyer. In contrast, Enron has wo=\nrked furiously to shed power plants and oil- and gas-generating fields, bel=\nieving it could earn higher returns using its trading and technology expert=\nise to tap assets owned by others in markets including steel, pulp, and pap=\ner. IRRESISTIBLE BARGAIN. As Enron's stock slid below $9 from its August, 2=\n000, high of $90, it became a bargain that Watson couldn't pass up. It woul=\nd have taken years for Dynegy to build up a market-making operation to matc=\nh Enron's. Its risk-management systems are top-of-the-line. Enron's commerc=\nial-services unit, which manages power supplies for corporate customers suc=\nh as Wendy's International Inc., is three or four years ahead of Dynegy's, =\nsays Steve Bergstrom, president of Dynegy. Watson says he still plans to ge=\nt rid of the $8 billion worth of assets Lay had earmarked for sale, includi=\nng the Portland (Ore.) General Electric plant and oil and gas assets in Ind=\nia. For the $1.5 billion, though, if the deal falls through Dynegy will hav=\ne the right to Enron's prized Northern Natural Gas pipeline, worth an estim=\nated $2.25 billion. And Dynegy can walk away if Enron's legal liabilities e=\nxceed $3.5 billion.=20\nWatson firmly believes that Enron suffered from a crisis of confidence, not=\n a meltdown of its core business. Indeed, Enron's wholesale-trading operati=\non earned $2.3 billion last year. Says Watson: ``We know the business. We l=\nooked under the hood, and guess what? It's just as strong as we thought it =\nwas.''=20\nBut the trading profits were obscured in recent weeks by Enron's accounting=\n tricks. The biggest danger for Watson is that there are other time bombs t=\nicking away. Already, the company has slashed its reported earnings since 1=\n997 by $591 million, or 20% of its total, to account for controversial part=\nnerships involving Enron officials. The Securities & Exchange Commission is=\n still investigating. ``We believe it will take more than just a couple of =\nweeks and a long-term relationship [between Watson and Lay] to do all the n=\necessary due diligence,'' says analyst Carol Coale of Prudential Securities=\n Inc. Dynegy's Bergstrom counters: ``We're pretty certain that most everyth=\ning of material consideration has been disclosed.'' If not? The massive ear=\nnings boost provides ``a high margin of error,'' he says. A WANNABE. Of cou=\nrse, regulators may object to the concentration of trading operations. And =\nWatson will have to mesh two very different cultures. Enron is known for it=\ns intense, even cutthroat entrepreneurial spirit. Dynegy's operations are m=\nore conservative; some compare it to a fraternity. Dynegy's decision to iss=\nue new stock options to some Enron employees may soothe battered egos. It s=\nhould help, too, that Lay decided not to take the $60 million golden parach=\nute he could have received in a buyout. As it is, Lay will not have a manag=\nement job with the new company.=20\nDynegy often seemed to be an Enron wannabe, following it into online tradin=\ng and commercial services. Still, Dynegy's 361% stock gains last year eclip=\nsed Enron's 87% rise, and it rankled some that Lay's execs got more credit.=\n ``Chuck Watson may not have been in the spotlight, but he has always been =\nat the forefront of this business,'' says Bruce M. Withers, who sold his Tr=\nident NGL Inc. to Dynegy in 1995. Watson will get more attention next year-=\n-he's a 15% owner of the new Houston Texans pro football team.

Here's what companies should do-=\n-and what investors need to know\nBy Nanette Byrnes and David Henry=20\nWith Mike McNamee in Washington\n\n11/26/2001\nBusinessWeek\n76\n(Copyright 2001 McGraw-Hill, Inc.)\n\nIn an age when giant earnings write-offs have become commonplace, it's hard=\n to shock Wall Street. But on Nov. 8, Enron Corp. managed to do it. After y=\nears of high-octane growth that had seen earnings surge by up to 24% a year=\n, the Houston-based energy company acknowledged that results for the past t=\nhree years were actually overstated by more than a half-billion dollars. It=\n was confirmation of investors' worst fears. Three weeks earlier, Enron had=\n announced a big drop in shareholders' equity, sparking fears that its hide=\nously complex financial statements were distorting its true performance. Ma=\nnagement pointed to a number of factors, including a dubious decision to ex=\nclude the results of three partnerships from its financial statements and a=\n billion-dollar error several years earlier that had inflated the company's=\n net worth.=20\nEnron may be an extreme example of a company whose performance fell far sho=\nrt of the glowing picture painted by management in its earnings releases, b=\nut it is hardly alone. This year, Corporate America is expected to charge o=\nff a record $125 billion, much of it for assets, investments, and inventory=\n that aren't worth as much as management thought (chart, page 79). Even if =\ncompanies don't go back and restate earnings, as Enron is doing, those char=\nges cast doubt on the record-breaking earnings growth of the late '90s.\nNot since the 1930s has the quality of corporate earnings been such an issu=\ne--and so difficult for investors to determine. There's more at stake than =\nthe fortunes of those who bought shares based on misleading numbers. If eve=\nn the most sophisticated financial minds can't figure out what a company ac=\ntually earns, that has implications far beyond Enron. U.S. financial market=\ns have a reputation for integrity that took decades to build. It has made t=\nhe U.S. the gold standard for financial reporting and the preeminent place =\nto invest. It has also ensured ready access to capital for U.S. corporation=\ns. That a company such as Enron, a member of the Standard & Poor's 500-stoc=\nk index and one of the largest companies on the New York Stock Exchange, co=\nuld fall so far so fast shows how badly that gold standard has been tarnish=\ned. ``The profession of auditing and accounting is, in fact, in crisis,'' s=\nays Paul A. Volcker, former chairman of the Federal Reserve and now one of =\nthe leaders of the International Accounting Standards Board.=20\nSometimes, as in the case of Enron, fuzzy numbers result from questionable =\ndecisions in figuring net earnings. More often, though, the earnings chaos =\nresults from a disturbing trend among companies to calculate profits in the=\nir own idiosyncratic ways--and an increasing willingness among investors an=\nd analysts to accept those nonstandard tallies, which appear under a variet=\ny of names, from ``pro forma'' to ``core.'' (Enron offers its own such vers=\nion. Before investors untangled the importance of Enron's first announcemen=\nt, its stock rose briefly because it told investors that its ``recurring ne=\nt income'' had met expectations.) The resulting murk makes it difficult to =\nanswer the most basic question in investing: What did my company earn?=20\nWhy calculate a second set of earnings in the first place? Because the numb=\ners reached by applying generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) are=\n woefully inadequate when it comes to giving investors a good sense of a co=\nmpany's prospects. Many institutional investors, most Wall Street analysts,=\n and even many accountants say GAAP is irrelevant. ``I don't know anyone wh=\no uses GAAP net income anymore for anything,'' says Lehman Brothers Inc. ac=\ncounting expert Robert Willens. The problem is that GAAP includes a lot of =\nnoncash charges and one-time expenses. While investors need to be aware of =\nthose charges, they also need a number that pertains solely to the performa=\nnce of ongoing operations.=20\nThat's what operating earnings are supposed to do. But because they're calc=\nulated in an ad hoc manner, with each company free to use its own rules, co=\nmparisons between companies have become meaningless. ``No investor--certain=\nly not any ordinary investor--can read these in a way that's useful,'' says=\n Harvey L. Pitt, chairman of the Securities & Exchange Commission. The SEC =\nis examining whether new rules are needed to clarify financial reports and =\nperhaps restrict use of pro formas.=20\nWhat's badly needed is a set of rules for calculating operating earnings an=\nd a requirement to make clear how they relate to net income. In the end, in=\nvestors need two numbers--a standardized operating number and an audited ne=\nt-income number--and a clear explanation of how to get from one to the othe=\nr. ``OUT OF HAND.'' A widespread consensus is building to do just that. In =\nearly November, S&P proposed a set of rules for companies to follow when ta=\nllying operating earnings. Only the week before, the Financial Accounting S=\ntandards Board, the rulemakers for GAAP, had announced that they, too, woul=\nd be taking up this issue. Volcker says the International Accounting Standa=\nrds Board is also seeking a uniform definition of operating earnings.=20\n``Over the past two or three years, the use of creative earnings measures h=\nas grown and grown and grown to the point where it has really gotten out of=\n hand,'' says David M. Blitzer, S&P's chief investment strategist. ``Earnin=\ngs are one of the key measures that anybody looks at when they're trying to=\n evaluate a company. If people want to use an operating-earnings measure, w=\ne better all know what we're looking at.''=20\nWithout those standards in place, the gap between earnings according to gen=\nerally accepted accounting principles and earnings according to Wall Street=\n is only going to grow wider and more confusing. Look at the variance in ea=\nrnings per share calculated for the S&P 500 for the third quarter: It's $10=\n.78 according to Wall Street analysts as tallied by Thomson Financial/First=\n Call, $9.17 according to S&P, and $6.37 according to numbers reported to t=\nhe SEC under GAAP. (S&P, like BusinessWeek, is owned by The McGraw-Hill Com=\npanies.)=20\nThe lack of a standard measure can be costly to those who choose wrong. Use=\n First Call's earnings for the past four quarters and you get a relatively =\nmodest price-earnings ratio of 23 for the S&P 500. But run the numbers usin=\ng GAAP earnings, and suddenly the market has a far steeper p-e of 38.=20\nHow did we get into this mess? Investors and analysts have been calculating=\n operating earnings for years, and for years, reasonable people could more =\nor less agree on how to do it. Then came the dot-com bubble, along with inc=\nreased pressure from Wall Street for companies to meet their quarterly earn=\nings forecasts. Suddenly, companies that hadn't turned a profit by any conv=\nentional measure started offering ever more inventive earnings variants. Th=\nese customized pro forma calculations excluded a grab bag of expenses and a=\nllowed upstart companies to show a profit. ``TOWER OF BABEL.'' Pro forma fo=\nrmulas vary wildly from company to company and even from quarter to quarter=\n within the same company, casting doubt on their validity. And these days, =\nthe gulf between net earnings and pro forma earnings is wider than ever. S&=\nP's tallies fall between the two: S&P's numbers are more systematic than pr=\no forma, but they aren't followed widely enough to be a standard. ``Investo=\nrs are facing a Tower of Babel,'' says Robert K. Elliott, former chief of t=\nhe American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) and a retired=\n KPMG partner. ``It's not standardized, and the numbers are not audited.''=\n=20\nThat makes it tough to evaluate a company's performance. In the quarter end=\ned on Sept. 30, Nortel Networks Corp. offered shareholders at least three e=\narnings numbers to choose from. By conservative GAAP accounting, the teleco=\nmmunications giant lost $1.08 a share. The company also provided two possib=\nle pro forma options: a 68 cents loss that excluded ``special charges,'' in=\ncluding some acquisition costs and restructuring charges, and a still bette=\nr 27 cents loss that further excluded $1.9 billion of ``incremental charges=\n,'' such as writing down inventories and increasing provisions for receivab=\nles. Wall Street chose the rosiest one.=20\nConfusing? You bet. Companies defend their pro forma calculations by pointi=\nng out that they're merely filling a void: Investors are clamoring for a me=\nasure that gives them better insight into their company's future. The goal =\nis to get to the core of the business and try to measure the outlook for th=\nose operations. ``There are good reasons why there is an emphasis on operat=\ning earnings,'' says Volcker. ``It is an effort to provide some continuity =\nand some reflection of the underlying progress of the company.'' Besides, a=\ns companies like to point out, they still have to report GAAP earnings, and=\n investors are free to ignore everything else.=20\nThere's no starker lesson in the shortcomings of GAAP than the $50 billion =\nasset write-downs by JDS Uniphase Corp., the biggest charge of the year. Ne=\nar the height of the telecom bull market in July, 2000, the San Jose (Calif=\n.) maker of fiber optics topped off a buying spree by acquiring competitor =\nSDL Inc. for $41 billion in stock. When the deal closed in February, its as=\nsets ballooned from $25 billion to $65 billion. But by then, shares of JDS =\nand other fiber-optics makers were collapsing. To bring its acquisitions in=\nto line with their new value, the company took charges of $50 billion. Desp=\nite the fact that the bulk of its losses stemmed from stock transactions an=\nd involved no cash paid, GAAP required that the charges be taken out of net=\n income. So according to GAAP, JDS lost $56 billion in the fiscal year endi=\nng in June--a staggering figure for a company whose revenues over the past =\nfive years added up to only $5 billion.=20\nAnalysts and the company argue that besides not involving cash, the charge-=\noff was all about the past, a right-sizing of values that had gotten out of=\n hand. To analyze the company's prospects, they excluded the $50 billion ch=\narge. ``The accounting is not designed to make things look better but to de=\nscribe what happened,'' says JDS Uniphase Chief Financial Officer Anthony R=\n. Muller, ``and we'll live with the consequences, whatever they are.'' Anal=\nysts make a similar defense. ``My goal is to figure out what the business i=\ns going to produce so that we can value the company,'' says Lehman Brothers=\n analyst Arnab Chanda. GLACIAL PACE. Are JDS's pro forma numbers realistic-=\n-a fair gauge of JDS's ongoing operations? Right now, it's hard for investo=\nrs to judge. And that's the kind of ambiguity S&P and others would like to =\neliminate. In November, S&P circulated a memo on how to standardize operati=\nng earnings. Under the proposal, operating earnings would include the costs=\n of purchases, research and development, restructuring costs (including sev=\nerance), write-downs from ongoing operations, and the cost to the company o=\nf stock options. It would exclude merger-and-acquisition expenses, impairme=\nnt of goodwill, litigation settlements, and the gain or loss on the sale of=\n an asset.=20\nWhen S&P applied roughly that formula to JDS Uniphase, it split the differe=\nnce between Wall Street and GAAP. Because of differences in what each group=\n included in their earnings calculations, the results were chaotic. Using G=\nAAP, the company lost $9.39 a share. S&P figures it lost $3.19, while the c=\nompany put the loss at 36 cents. Meanwhile, Wall Street says it made 2 cent=\ns.=20\nThe S&P standard may make sense, but it raises the question: Where is the F=\ninancial Accounting Standards Board, the group in charge of GAAP? Chairman =\nEdmund L. Jenkins says FASB will be addressing the problems. Still, investo=\nrs shouldn't expect any improvement soon. The pace of change at FASB tends =\nto be glacial. It typically takes four years to complete a new standard. In=\n 1996, for example, the board realized that standards on restructuring char=\nges had some big loopholes and it resolved to put the issue on its agenda. =\nIn June, 2000, the board finally issued a draft of a new standard, asked fo=\nr comments, and held a public hearing. In October, 2001, the board said it =\nstill wasn't ready to put a fix in place. Now, the recession has set off an=\nother wave of restructuring charges, and the FASB still doesn't have new ru=\nles.=20\nThe slow pace means the standard-setters sometimes fail to react to sudden =\nchanges in the market. The most recent failure followed the terrorist attac=\nks on September 11. An FASB task force, unable to come up with a set of rul=\nes for separating September 11 costs from general expenses, instead told co=\nmpanies that the disaster could not be treated as an extraordinary item. So=\n GAAP earnings include costs stemming from the disaster as part of a compan=\ny's general performance. Many companies have nevertheless broken those cost=\ns out in their unaudited press releases.=20\nMany more are likely to do so in the fourth quarter. Indeed, 2001 is shapin=\ng up to be one for the record books. A poor economy and the devastating aft=\nereffects of September 11 have resulted in a slew of unusual charges that a=\nre unlikely to recur and that no one could have foreseen. But there's a gro=\nwing concern that the earnings fog is providing managers with cover to hide=\n missteps of the past within that vast category of supposedly one-time char=\nges. The temptation will be to take as big a charge as possible now, while =\ninvestors are braced for bad news. Not only can managers sweep away yesterd=\nay's errors, but tomorrow's earnings will look even better.=20\nThe basic question comes down to what constitutes a special expense--a char=\nge so unusual that to include it in the earnings calculation would be to di=\nstort the truth about a company's performance. Usually, big charges fall in=\nto a few categories, including charges for laying off workers and restructu=\nring a company, charges for assets that have lost value since they were pur=\nchased, charges for investments that have lost value, and charges for inven=\ntory that has become obsolete. In a recent study, Harvard Business School p=\nrofessor Mark T. Bradshaw found that companies are increasingly calling the=\nse charges unusual. That gives them a rationale for excluding them from the=\nir pro forma calculations.=20\nLots of critics disagree, saying such charges are often an inevitable part =\nof the business cycle and should be reflected in a company's earnings histo=\nry. They certainly should not be ignored by investors. ``Charges are real s=\nhareholder wealth that's been lost,'' argues David W. Tice, manager of the =\nPrudent Bear Fund, a mutual fund with a pessimistic bent that's up 17% so f=\nar this year. ``It's money they spent on something no longer worth what it =\nwas, a correction of past earnings, or a reserve for costs moving forward. =\nWhatever the reason, it's a real cost to the company, and that hurts shareh=\nolders.'' Without standards, excessive write-offs from operating earnings c=\nan obscure actual performance. Without any rules, companies calculate opera=\nting earnings inconsistently in order to put their companies in the best po=\nssible light. Dell Computer Corp. is a good example of this ``heads I win, =\ntails you lose'' school of accounting. For years, Dell benefited from gains=\n in its venture-capital investments and was happy to include those gains in=\n its reported earnings, where they appeared as a separate line on the incom=\ne statement. But this year, when those gains turned to losses, the computer=\n maker issued pro forma numbers that excluded that $260 million drag. Dell =\nspokesman Michael Maher says the company's press releases and SEC filings b=\nreak out investment income and give GAAP numbers as well as pro forma. ``In=\n our view, the numbers are reported clearly,'' says Maher. ``It's all out t=\nhere for the consuming public.'' PAST PUFFERY. Many experts believe special=\n charges are a sign that past performance was exaggerated. What should inve=\nstors make of a company such as Gateway Inc.? Two restructuring charges in =\nthe first and third quarters, minus a small extraordinary gain, totaled $1.=\n12 billion, or about $100 million more than the company made in 1998, 1999,=\n and 2000 combined. Which is the truer picture of its performance and poten=\ntial? The write-offs or the earnings? Write-offs for customer financing are=\n another example. When Nortel increased its reserves for credit extended to=\n customers by $767 million in September, it effectively admitted it had boo=\nked sales in the past to companies that couldn't pay--in effect overstating=\n its performance in those earlier periods. In addition, Nortel says booking=\n sales and accounting for credit are unrelated issues. Tech companies blame=\n the sharp downturn in their industry for the big write-offs. And these are=\nn't isolated examples. Peter L. Bernstein, publisher of newsletter Economic=\ns & Portfolio Strategy, found that from 1989 to 1993, 20% of earnings vanis=\nhed into write-offs.=20\nBig charge-offs can also distort future performance. Critics contend that e=\nxcess reserves are often used as a sort of ``cookie jar'' from which earnin=\ngs can be taken in future quarters to meet Wall Street's expectations. Or c=\nharges taken this year, for example, which is apt to be a lousy one for mos=\nt companies anyway, might include costs that would otherwise have been take=\nn in future periods. Prepaying those costs gives a big boost to later earni=\nngs. Rules for figuring operating earnings would help, but this is an area =\nthat will always involve a certain amount of judgment--and therefore invite=\n a certain amount of abuse. ``People are going to write off everything they=\n can in the next two quarters because they're having a bad year anyway,'' s=\nays Robert G. Atkins, a Mercer Management consultant.=20\nPart of the lure of big special charges is that investors tend to shrug the=\nm off, believing that with the bad news out in the open, the company is poi=\nsed for a brighter future. Since Gateway detailed its third-quarter charge =\nof $571 million on Oct. 18, Wall Street has bid the stock up 48%, compared =\nwith a 6% runup for the S&P 500.=20\nOften, though, investors should take exactly the opposite message. If, for =\nexample, part of a restructuring involves slashing employee training, infor=\nmation-technology spending, or research and development, the cuts could dep=\nress future performance, says Baruch Lev, a professor of accounting at the =\nStern School of Business at New York University. ``Are these really one-tim=\ne events?'' he asks. ``Or is this the beginning of an avalanche?'' Indeed, =\nMorgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co. strategist Steve Galbraith has found that =\nin the year following a big charge-off to earnings companies have underperf=\normed the stock market by 20 percentage points. ``LA LA LAND.'' Investors a=\nre apt to be faced with more huge write-offs next year, even if the economy=\n doesn't continue to worsen. Why? The transition to a new GAAP rule that ch=\nanges the way companies account for goodwill--a balance-sheet asset that re=\nflects the amount paid for an acquisition over the net value of the tangibl=\ne assets. Under the new rule, companies will have to assess their propertie=\ns periodically and decrease their worth on the balance sheet if their value=\n falls. An informal survey by Financial Executives International of its mem=\nber controllers and financial officers found that at least a third expect t=\no take more charges.=20\nBut figuring out the proper value of those assets is no easy task. Unless t=\nhere is a comparable company or factory with an established market price, v=\naluing them involves a lot of guesswork for which there are no firm rules. =\n``What this is really coming down to is corporations and their auditors com=\ning up with their own tests for impairment,'' says the Stern School's Profe=\nssor Paul R. Brown. ``It's La La Land.''=20\nWhile the tidal wave of special charges is providing cover for earnings gam=\nes, it could also be an impetus for change--especially in the wake of the d=\not-com fiasco. Indeed, there are some signs of a backlash. The real estate =\ninvestment trust industry was a pioneer of engineered earnings, with its ``=\nfunds from operations,'' or FFO. But now some REITs have begun to revert to=\n plain old GAAP earnings. Hamid R. Moghadam, CEO of San Francisco-based AMB=\n Property Corp., shifted back to GAAP in 1999. ``The reason I don't like FF=\nO is very simple,'' says Moghadam. ``One company's numbers look better than=\n another one's even if they had identical fundamental results.''=20\nThere are other steps FASB could take to improve financial reporting and re=\nstore GAAP's status. Trevor S. Harris, an accounting expert at Morgan Stanl=\ney, says it could force companies to make clear distinctions between income=\n from operations and income from financial transactions. Lehman's Willens s=\nays companies should provide more information on cash expenses and how they=\n bear on earnings. An easy step would be to require companies to file their=\n press releases with the SEC.=20\nAt the least, says Lev, companies must clearly explain how their pro forma =\nnumbers relate to the GAAP numbers. Otherwise, he says, investors ``see num=\nbers floating there, and where did they come from?'' In today's environment=\n of unregulated pro forma calculations and supersize write-offs, no questio=\nn is more important to investors.\n\nHigh-Gloss Glossary\nCompanies are using a variety of accounting practices to put the best spin =\non\ntheir results. Here's what those terms mean:\nDEFINING EARNINGS:\nNET INCOME\nThe bottom line, according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAA=\nP).\nSometimes called ``reported earnings,'' these are the numbers the Securitie=\ns &\nExchange Commission accepts in its filings.\nOPERATING EARNINGS\nAn adjustment of net income that excludes certain costs deemed to be unrela=\nted\nto the ongoing business. Although it sounds deceptively like a GAAP figure\ncalled ``operating income'' (revenue minus the costs of doing business), it=\n is\nnot an audited figure.\nCORE EARNINGS\nAnother term for operating earnings. Neither core nor operating earnings ar=\ne\ncalculated according to set rules. They can include or exclude anything the\npreparer wishes.\nPRO FORMA EARNINGS\nThe 1990s term for operating earnings. Popularized by dot-coms, it sometime=\ns\nexcludes such basic costs as marketing and interest.\nEBITDA\nEarnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. The\ngranddaddy of pro forma, it was initially highlighted by industries that\ncarried high debt loads, such as cable TV, but has since come to be widely\nquoted.\nADJUSTED EARNINGS\nA new term for pro forma.\nDEFINING COSTS:\nSPECIAL CHARGES\nA general term for anything a company wants to highlight as unusual and\ntherefore to be excluded from future earnings projections.\nASSET IMPAIRMENTS\nCharges taken to bring something a company paid a high price for down to it=\ns\ncurrent market value. Many companies are now taking these charges on intern=\nal\nventure-capital funds that bought Internet and other high-tech stocks at\ninflated prices.\nGOODWILL IMPAIRMENTS\nThe same idea as asset impairments except they're used to write down the\npremium a company paid over the fair market value of the net tangible asset=\ns\nacquired. These charges will explode in the first quarter of 2002 because o=\nf a\nchange in mergers-and-acquisitions accounting that eliminates goodwill\namortization and requires holdings to be carried at no more than fair value=\ns.\nRESTRUCTURING RESERVES\nAn accrued expense (not usually cash) to cover future costs of closing down=\n a\nportion of a business, a plant, or of firings. These are projected costs an=\nd\nif overstated can later become a boost to earnings as they are reversed.\nWRITE-DOWN\nLowering the value of an asset, such as a plant or stock investment. It is\noften excused as a bookkeeping exercise, but there may have been a real cos=\nt\nlong ago that now proves ill spent, or there may have been associated cash\ncosts, such as investment-banking fees.\nIllustration: Chart: THE BIG BATH CHART BY ERIC HOFFMANN/BW=20\nIllustration: Chart: EARNINGS CHAOS CHART BY ERIC HOFFMANN/BW=20\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

That's the most basic question an investor can e=\nver ask. The equity culture that has generated so much growth over the year=\ns depends on a clear answer, but getting one has become impossible. Enron C=\norp. just announced that its earnings for the past three years were oversta=\nted by half a billion dollars. How did one of the biggest companies on the =\nNew York Stock Exchange manage to inflate its earnings by 20% without audit=\nors, analysts, ratings agencies, and the business press (BusinessWeek inclu=\nded) discovering it? In part, blame the breakdown of standardized accountin=\ng rules and the anarchy that runs rampant in the financial statements of Co=\nrporate America. The U.S. needs a new set of accounting rules that gives a =\nclear picture of financial performance. Without integrity in financial repo=\nrting, the U.S. cannot hope to remain the preeminent place to invest in the=\n global marketplace (page 76).=20\nThe dot-com bubble was the first indication that there was something seriou=\nsly wrong with accounting standards. Companies without much of a business m=\nodel customized their quarterly statements to exclude a grab bag of expense=\ns in order to put a positive financial spin on their operations. Wall Stree=\nt conspired in this and encouraged big companies to join in. Soon, the meth=\nod of calculating earnings began to vary from company to company and even f=\nrom quarter to quarter within a company. It is now chaos.\nA stricter adherence to accounting rules won't solve the entire problem. GA=\nAP, the generally accepted accounting principles, allow all kinds of one-ti=\nme expenses and noncash charges. This obscures the performance of ongoing o=\nperations. No one can fathom what are true operating earnings because there=\n are no guidelines as to what constitutes an extraordinary expense. The res=\nult is total confusion. Take earnings per share for the Standard & Poor's 5=\n00-stock index for the second quarter. Under Thomson Financial/First Call s=\ntandards, it is $11.82. But it's $9.02 according to S&P and $4.83 under GAA=\nP. How can investors make intelligent decisions?=20\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board clearly is failing to do its job. =\nIt has promised to write a set of rules that calculates operating earnings =\nand relates them to net earnings, but it hasn't delivered. The rating agenc=\ny Standard & Poor's (owned by The McGraw-Hill Companies, as is BusinessWeek=\n) is doing a better job. It recently drew up a definition of ``operating ea=\nrnings'' that includes restructuring costs (including severance), writedown=\ns from ongoing operations, and the cost of stock options. It excludes merge=\nr and acquisition expenses, litigation settlements, impairment of goodwill,=\n and gains or losses on asset sales. This is a beginning that FASB should b=\nuild on. The accounting anarchy has to end.\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

But the stock market, after an initial selloff, has=\n shown remarkable resilience.=20\nFew observers expect stock-market volatility to subside soon. Still, expert=\ns say that now, more than ever, is the time for skittish investors to keep =\ntheir wits about them.\nIn a recent interview, Charles R. Schwab, chairman and co-chief executive o=\nf Charles Schwab & Co., the San Francisco-based online and discount brokera=\nge firm, gave his views on what investors should be doing -- and what mista=\nkes they should avoid.=20\nHere are some excerpts from the interview:=20\nIn the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks, how much more risk, if any, do you thi=\nnk is in the financial markets? Or do you think it's just that people's per=\nceptions about risk have changed?=20\nI've been investing since 1959, and I have to say that, year after year, th=\ne risk hasn't changed. The risk is always there. There's risk in investing =\nin stocks, bonds and even U.S. Treasuries because of interest-rate [fluctua=\ntions]. There's risk in real estate, too.=20\nSo the question is: How do you handle it? The best way is to diversify. Ove=\nr a long period of time, people who diversify their investments do pretty d=\narned well. When they don't . . . sometimes it's fatal. If the only stock a=\nn investor owned was Enron . . . or Cisco at 70, that was pretty fatal.=20\nWhat do you say to people who say they're too scared to invest right now? T=\nhat because of the threat of terrorism, the anthrax scares, the war in Afgh=\nanistan, the recession, and so forth, there's just too much uncertainty in =\nthe markets?=20\nI remember back during the Cuban missile crisis, we all feared the worst. W=\ne were all building bomb shelters. It was a scary time. This terrorist thin=\ng is no different. It's awful -- particularly for our children. But this co=\nuntry is so wealthy, in terms of its resources, intellectual capital and th=\ne strength of our government.=20\nThere is no more uncertainty today than in times past. For example, we've h=\nad many recessions. It's not fun, especially when you begin reading about a=\nll these layoffs. In fact, I think the unemployment rate [now at 5.4%] pret=\nty easily might get to 6.5% before it gets better. And it probably won't ge=\nt better until March or April. Also, the stock market will go up, hopefully=\n before the economy goes up.=20\nThere's $2 trillion sitting in money-market accounts. That's a huge resourc=\ne and buying power that's definitely available for new investments.=20\nWhat do you think is the biggest mistake investors have made over the past =\ntwo or so months?=20\nThey let their emotions take over. With the fear that people had, they didn=\n't use their rational thinking. They used their emotional thinking. [After =\nSept. 11], they sold at the low, and fear was the driver.=20\nJust a year and a half ago, the driving emotion was greed. You're not going=\n to avoid this stuff. So the issue is how you manage through these cycles o=\nf fear and greed. Even when I'm fearful of something, I say to myself: \"Thi=\ns is still the time to invest.\"=20\nMy biggest worry right now is that people will give up and say, \"I just don=\n't want to be in the stock market at all.\" And it's just the time that peop=\nle should be hanging on and keeping a diversified portfolio.=20\nSome other mistakes: A lot of people hang on to the stock that was the post=\ner child of the last cycle.

At Friday's closing price of $4.71, the s=\ntock sells for less than half the $10.85 that Dynegy is slated to pay in th=\ne acquisition. That's a sign investors are skeptical the transaction will g=\no through as planned.=20\nEnron is likely to have approached Kohlberg, Kravis Roberts & Co., Blacksto=\nne Group and Carlyle Group for a private equity investment, said industry a=\nnalyst David Snow of PrivateEquityCentral.Net.=20\nThe firms have declined to comment.=20\nIn a conference call Nov. 14, Enron Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey McMahon=\n said the company is in talks with several private investors and expects to=\n receive $500 million to $1 billion from those sources.=20\nOn Wednesday, Enron got a three-week reprieve from lenders on a $690-millio=\nn note due this week, gaining more time to restructure its finances. Dynegy=\n Chief Executive Chuck Watson said he was \"encouraged\" by the commitment to=\n extend the note payment as well as the closing of a $450-million credit fa=\ncility. He said Dynegy remained committed to the purchase.=20\nEnron already received $1.5 billion in cash Nov. 13 from ChevronTexaco Inc.=\n as part of the Dynegy buyout agreement. In return, Dynegy received preferr=\ned stock and other rights in an Enron unit that owns the Northern Natural G=\nas Co. pipeline. Under the deal's terms, if Dynegy and Enron fail to merge,=\n Dynegy can acquire the pipeline company.=20\nBut Barron's reported over the weekend that Dynegy's right to the pipeline =\nmight be challenged by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Salomon Smith Barney Inc=\n., which accepted the asset as collateral for $1billion in loans to Enron.=\n=20\nDynegy spokesman John Sousa declined to comment on Enron's attempts to secu=\nre financing or whether more cash for Enron is a condition of keeping the m=\nerger alive.=20\nEnron's dealings with affiliated partnerships have led to a federal investi=\ngation of the company, which restated its earnings and saw its credit ratin=\ngs cut.=20\nThe company said in a Securities and Exchange filing a week ago that it has=\n less than $2 billion in cash and credit lines left.\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

(DYN) remains optimistic, after further re=\nview of Enron Corp.'s (ENE) finances last week, that it will be able to buy=\n the company, the Financial Times reported Monday.=20\nDynegy said that it, \"remained optimistic for the potential of the merger t=\no be completed, and in the time frame we originally announced - six to nine=\n months,\" the FT reported.\nCritical investment in Enron by J.P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup will procee=\nd only if an unofficial pact between Enron, Dynegy, and Enron's lenders and=\n credit rating agencies remains intact, the report said. Investment from th=\nese two is likely to total between $500 million and $1 billion, while Enron=\n continues to look for a further $500 million from private equity firms.=20\nThe deal suffered a setback last week, when a regulatory filing revealed a =\ngreater debt burden than some investors had realized. Enron's share price f=\nell following the report, to $4.74 from $9.00.=20\nA $1 billion secured credit line from J.P. Morgan Chase and an extension of=\n a $690 million repayment due Tuesday weren't enough to keep the share pric=\ne from falling. This led to speculation that Dynegy was considering renegot=\niating its all-stock bid, now at $9.3 billion, compared with Enron's market=\n value of $3.5 billion, said the report.=20\nRenegotiating the deal wouldn't have any impact on Enron's finances, unname=\nd sources told the FT.=20\nBut if Dynegy pulled out of the deal altogether, there might be no cash inf=\nusion from J.P. Morgan chase and Citigroup. Credit ratings agencies could t=\nhen downgrade Enron's debt to junk, forcing partners to repay debts, the re=\nport said.=20\n-By Sarah Spikes, Dow Jones Newswires; +44-(0)20-7842-9345; sarah.spikes@do=\nwjones.com\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

All Rights Reserved. =09\n\nThe Enron scandal\nA V Rajwade\n\n11/26/2001\nBusiness Standard\n10\nCopyright (c) Business Standard\n\nEnron has always been recognised by other companies as best practice in ris=\nk management. It put in systems to manage risks on a real-time basis and ha=\nd very strong management.\" James Lam, founder of eRisk, a consulting firm.=\n=20\nAs an occasional teacher and more regularly a student of the subject of man=\nagement of price risks, I have been an admirer of Enron's elaborate disclos=\nure of its risk management practices. And yet, in a cascade of events over =\na period of just three weeks from mid-October, it lost two-thirds of its sh=\nare value, became the subject of a US Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) =\ninvestigation, and was taken over by a rival a third in size. (Latest repor=\nts create some doubt about whether this will go through.) What went wrong?\nNo, the events had nothing to do with Dabhol. Indeed, if, for us in India, =\nEnron will always be associated with the controversial power project, elsew=\nhere it is likely become a case study for students of accounting, finance a=\nnd general management. (On second thoughts, even its Indian adventures woul=\nd make an excellent case study!)=20\nBut first, a recount of what happened. After announcing on October 16, with=\nout much explanation or transparency, that it has taken a charge of $ 1.2 b=\nillion against equity, Enron's share price started tumbling. Apparently, th=\ne charge was the result of some financial transactions, and the SEC launche=\nd an investigation. The chief financial officer (CFO), who was directly inv=\nolved with the transactions, the company's treasurer and a couple of other =\nsenior officials were sacked.=20\nPerhaps most damagingly, Enron revised its accounts from 1997 onwards, redu=\ncing profits by about $ 600 million and increasing debt by a somewhat simil=\nar amount. As a result, Enron's credit rating was downgraded.=20\nIt seems the root problem was not in its basic business of power and gas tr=\nading, but in its investment activities controlled by the CFO. These compri=\nsed private equity, and Enron's share in each of the investee companies was=\n kept artificially below 50 per cent to avoid consolidation of accounts. To=\n this end, outside investors were brought in and assured of equity in Enron=\n itself, should the value of the investee company(ies) fall below agreed th=\nreshold(s).=20\nAll this was done to keep the losses in investments off-balance sheet, and =\nmitigate their impact on reported profits. Many other US corporations inclu=\nding J P Morgan Chase, which had large private equity investments, have suf=\nfered on this score (see World Money October 15). Enron wanted to avoid thi=\ns and, last year, paid its since-dismissed CFO $ 30 million for his creativ=\ne accounting genius.=20\nIncidentally, those enamoured of US GAAP and its alleged superiority over t=\nhe rest of the world should note that all these gimmicks were blessed by th=\ne company's auditors one of the Big Five firms, which was paid $ 25 million=\n as audit fees and $ 27 million for other services by Enron last year.=20\nThe restatement of the accounts from 1997 onwards became necessary as the E=\nnron management/board and the auditors were forced, on review, to admit tha=\nt at least some of the transactions should have been on, rather than off, b=\nalance sheet. Details of all the transactions in question are yet to come o=\nut, but what has come out is bad enough.=20\nBut this apart, a billion dollar hit for a company of the size ($ 300 billi=\non) or cash flow ($ 3 billion) of Enron is, by itself, hardly a death warra=\nnt. But it turned out to be just that for Enron.=20\nPerhaps because it was too arrogant? Perhaps also because its accounts lack=\ned transparency and their opaqueness ensured that investors' confidence was=\n always somewhat fragile?=20\nBut there are two other points worth noting: the professionalism of equity =\nanalysts and whether the event restores somewhat the balance between tradin=\ng and producing. As for the first, the professional analysts were surely aw=\nare of the opaqueness of the accounts,but few questioned the management agg=\nressively on the subject. Perhaps the stock was too glamorous and typified =\nthe spirit of the times trading assets was what the \"masters of the univers=\ne\" did, not the boring old business of producing oil or power or cars. The =\nEnron management itself was proud of the way it operated in its principal a=\nctivity of trading in power and gas, with Skilling, the former CEO, claming=\n that \"we are on the side of angels. We are taking on the entrenched monopo=\nlies. We are bringing the benefits of choice and free markets to the world.=\n\" (The quotation is from an interview in BusinessWeek, prior to Skilling's =\ninglorious exit from Enron a couple of weeks before the bubble burst).=20\nFor the analysts, there was also safety in numbers. Skilling claimed that \"=\nEnron's operations are built around the integration of modern financial tec=\nhnologies and physical technologies\", bringing derivatives theory to tradin=\ng in power and gas! Obviously, the fate of Long Term Capital Management has=\n not led to more sober management of trading risks.=20\nSurely the role of \"markets\" should be to reduce the distance, and cost, be=\ntween producer and consumer? One does feel that there is something perverse=\n in a society that values, in terms of compensation, the trader (don't forg=\net this is just a euphemism for the speculator) over the producer whether i=\nn the bond, currency or power and gas markets. The markets and, indeed, gre=\ned obviously have a role to play, but surely the pendulum needs to swing a =\nlittle bit to the left?\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  \n\nJeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.\n\nI know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.\n\nPlease join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work."

Last week a couple of heavy hitters left money on=\n the table.=20\nMark McGwire, the home-run-hitting baseball player for St. Louis, retired. =\nAnd he let it be known that he never signed a two-year, $30 million contrac=\nt his agent negotiated last spring. Why? Because he wanted to find out if h=\nis injured right knee would allow him to play as well as he had before. It =\ndidn't, and he decided he wasn't worth that kind of money.\nThen Ken Lay, chairman of Enron Corp., said he won't take the $60.6 million=\n he had coming to him in a severance agreement that comes into play when En=\nron is sold to Dynegy Corp.=20\nOf course, neither McGwire nor Lay will ever have to consider my fallback r=\netirement plan - sacking groceries at the supermarket, carrying them to the=\n car and hoping for a big tip. Still, it was a class act on both their part=\ns. McGwire only hit .187 last season, well below his lifetime average. And =\nLay? Well, let's say that rarely in the history of American capitalism has =\na company sunk as fast as Enron.=20\nRemember that earlier this year its stock hit a top of $82 a share. Now it'=\ns hovering in the single-digit level, and Enron is being forced to sell its=\nelf to a smaller rival.=20\nThe stock price incentive=20\nHow did Enron get into this position? Put the blame on the company's relent=\nless drive to push up its stock price. And a big reason for that push comes=\n from the way American companies compensate top executives.=20\nIn the last couple of decades, executive compensation has soared. The avera=\nge chief executive officer today makes 531 times as much in salary, bonuses=\n and stock options as the average factory worker.=20\nApologists for executive pay say these kinds of figures really aren't relev=\nant. Most of the money top executives receive doesn't come from base pay or=\n bonuses but from stock options.=20\nSuch options usually work this way. Executives are given hundreds or thousa=\nnds of shares of stock that they can only buy from the company at a future =\ndate. The sales price can be anything from 10 cents to the price of the sto=\nck on the date the options were granted. If the stock increases past the ex=\nercise price in the option, the executive can buy the stock and then sell i=\nt, making big bucks. It the stock has dropped below the option price - it's=\n underwater, in the jargon - then those options are worthless.=20\nGranting options aligns the interests of the top executives with the shareh=\nolders, those who favor this sort of incentive say. And that's true, if you=\n talking about in-and-out traders. But it's not true if we're looking out f=\nor the interests of the majority who hold stocks for the long term.=20\nKeeping the debt hidden=20\nKeeping its stock price soaring was what brought down Enron.=20\nTo hype the stock, Enron's execs were hiding the debt it took on to fuel it=\ns amazing growth and some of its dicier investments, in partnerships. Enron=\n was supposedly only a minority partner in these deals. That way it could m=\nove a large portion of its debt off its books in that partnership. That, in=\n turn, made the company's earnings look better.=20\nWhen Enron's executives finally fessed up, they had to write down their pro=\nfits over the past few years by 20 percent. But the real irony here is that=\n 80 percent is still a heck of a lot of money. But by that time, the majori=\nty of shareholders simply had no faith in Enron's bookkeeping.=20\nNow look at Lay's compensation. In 1999 he exercised stock options and made=\n $44 million on them. In 2000, sales of options brought him $123 million, a=\nnd this year about $26 million, according to a study published by Bloomberg=\n News.=20\nWas Lay deliberating deceiving investors to keep his stock options profitab=\nle? I don't think so. He was simply following the latest fad in corporate g=\novernance. He was aligning himself with the interests of the shareholders.=\n=20\nThe shareholders were happy with that high stock price. Nobody - besides so=\nme stock analysts - complained about Enron's often- impenetrable bookkeepin=\ng until that stock price started to fall.=20\nWould Enron's bookkeeping have been different if top executives received fe=\nwer stock options? Maybe.=20\nFewer stock options would mean lower pay for the top guys. And no one would=\n want that job if he were only going to make $10 million a year instead of =\n$100 million.=20\nJust kidding.\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

All Rights Reserved. =09\n\n\nMoney and Business/Financial Desk; Section 3\nInvesting\nBullish, and Patient, on Energy Stocks\nBy JAN M. ROSEN\n\n11/18/2001\nThe New York Times\nPage 8, Column 2\nc. 2001 New York Times Company\n\nDESPITE last week's plunge in the price of crude oil and in shares of big o=\nil companies, some Wall Street analysts remain upbeat about the long-term p=\nrospects for energy stocks.=20\n''These very dramatic downturns are great buying opportunities,'' said Tina=\n Vital, an oil and gas analyst at Standard & Poor's, who recommends a broad=\n group of integrated oil companies, including Exxon Mobil, ChevronTexaco, R=\noyal Dutch/Shell, BP and TotalFinaElf. ''They have excellent management, a =\ntop dividend yield and are a safe haven for investors,'' she said, provided=\n that investors are patient and can bear short-term swings.\nLast week's price declines were set off by Russian oil companies' refusal t=\no accept demands by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries f=\nor big production cuts. They were a reminder that the sector is extremely v=\nolatile. ''Oil could go to $10 a barrel short term,'' she said, but there i=\ns no certainty of that. The oil producers could reach an agreement by Janua=\nry, sending prices upward. Over the long term, she expects to see productio=\nn cuts.=20\nDemand for energy has grown only 0.5 percent this year, and prices have bee=\nn declining for some time for both crude oil and gasoline -- as drivers hav=\ne seen at the gas pump. West Texas intermediate crude closed Friday at $18.=\n03 on the New York Mercantile Exchange, up 58 cents from its Thursday close=\n, the lowest since June 1999. But an economic recovery, expected by late 20=\n02, could cause demand to pick up, analysts say.=20\nAs oil prices have dropped, so have the prices of most oil stocks, but not =\nas much as the overall market since the beginning of 2000. Over that period=\n, the S.& P. energy index has lost 8 percent, while the S.& P. 500-stock in=\ndex is down 23 percent.=20\nA report issued last week by the Energy Department said that while the Sept=\n. 11 terrorist attacks had intensified the country's economic slowdown, ''t=\nhey are not expected to result in any long-term volatility in energy market=\ns.'' The report estimated that commercial energy demand would rise 1.7 perc=\nent a year through 2020, instead of the 1.2 percent predicted only a year a=\ngo. Its predictions assume increased use of computers and office equipment,=\n and slower increases in fuel efficiency for cars and trucks.=20\nWHILE they warn of the possibility of wild price shifts in the months ahead=\n, other analysts are similarly bullish for the long term. L. Bruce Lanni, s=\nenior oil analyst at A. G. Edwards & Sons in New York, said that any potent=\nial price war was likely to be fairly short-lived, because neither OPEC nor=\n non-OPEC countries could ''withstand low oil prices for a prolonged period=\n of time,'' and prices should rebound sharply as a result, ''back up in the=\n lower to mid-$20 range.''=20\nLow prices could be painful for most of the oil companies in the short term=\n, but Mr. Lanni, too, sees value in the stocks.=20\nHis top pick is Conoco, now trading at $24.30; his 12-month target is $34. =\n''We remain confident,'' he said, ''that the company's annual oil and gas p=\nroduction should grow by about 4 percent, on average, over the next several=\n years.''=20\nConoco's debt, at 55 percent of capital, is relatively high, but he expects=\n the company's strong cash flow -- it equaled $5.33 a share last year -- to=\n reduce the debt level to 46 percent next year and to 38 percent in 2003. T=\nhe company's after-tax interest cost is only 3.5 percent, he said.=20\nMr. Lanni also favors Kerr-McGee, a natural gas exploration and production =\ncompany, and BP, calling both undervalued. He regards Exxon Mobil, Royal Du=\ntch/Shell and ChevronTexaco as fully priced, so he is not recommending buyi=\nng them now. ''If you own them, hold them,'' he said.=20\nWilliam Featherston, executive director and an oil and gas exploration anal=\nyst at UBS Warburg, said he felt ''near-term caution but medium-term optimi=\nsm for sustainably higher'' natural gas prices. He said he would encourage =\ninvestors to consider buying shares of exploration and production companies=\n over the next two months. His top picks are Apache, Kerr-McGee and EOG Res=\nources.=20\nSuch stocks are highly volatile, he said. They are ''trading-oriented vehic=\nles, and short-term volatility in commodity prices generally provides the m=\nost attractive entry and exit points,'' he said. ''While natural gas prices=\n declined throughout most of this year, prices rose at a startling pace, fr=\nom $1.75 per million cubic feet at the end of September to over $3 per mill=\nion cubic feet within weeks.''=20\nHe cited three reasons for the price rally: a decline in gas surpluses, pre=\ndictions of a colder-than-normal winter and what he has called ''pathetic t=\nhird-quarter natural gas production,'' despite record drilling activity.=20\nThe tangled finances of the Enron Corporation were also a factor in the rec=\nent price increase for natural gas futures, he said. Enron, which marketed =\n25 billion cubic feet a day of natural gas, or more than 40 percent of the =\nnation's demand, is under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Comm=\nission and announced a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity from de=\nals with partnerships involving its former chief financial officer. It also=\n reported a third-quarter loss and restated earlier earnings. Enron has agr=\need to be taken over by Dynegy, a smaller rival, for about $9 billion in st=\nock. Dynegy is also assuming about $13 billion in debt.=20\nAnxiety over whether the Enron investigation would disrupt deliveries or ha=\nve other market repercussions led to an increase in prices. While it is ''d=\nifficult to quantify the Enron factor,'' Mr. Featherston said, the short-te=\nrm effects on natural gas prices seem to be over.=20\nOTHER factors, of course, could also mean a bumpy ride for energy investors=\n over the next several months. The status of the war against terrorism, Pre=\nsident Bush's decision to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, thus helpin=\ng OPEC in reducing excess global capacity, and a United Nations review of t=\nhe food-for-oil deal with Iraq expected in December could each have a signi=\nficant impact on battered oil prices.=20\nNevertheless, Ms. Vital said, for the long term, energy will probably be in=\n short supply, and new sources must be developed. So she also likes the pro=\nspects of two drilling companies, Noble Drilling and Nabors Industries. Bot=\nh took a beating last week, along with the oil companies, so again she sees=\n buying opportunities.=20\nBern Fleming, portfolio manager of the AXP Utilities Income fund in Minneap=\nolis, who has stakes in Dynegy, Duke Energy and Dominion Resources, said al=\nl three had good prospects for growth, thanks to a mix of assets, ''managem=\nent I respect and solid business plans.''\n\nPhoto: Workers at an oil well near Lafayette, La.

Enron's\ncollapse would have caused upheaval in energy markets, where the\ncompany does one-quarter of all gas and power trades.\n\n     Dynegy's agreement to buy Enron allows it to withdraw from\nthe transaction under certain circumstances, the FT said.\n\n\n\nPERSPECTIVES\nA tale of greed and hubris\nWaldo Proffitt\n\n11/18/2001\nSarasota Herald-Tribune\nAll\nF2\n(Copyright 2001)\n\nFor anyone not already disenchanted with the idea of total deregulation of =\npublic utilities, the most recent installment of the miserable Enron story =\nas it unfolded last week should serve as a convincing example of the folly =\nof relying on unregulated profit- driven enterprises to supply our energy.=\n=20\nA year ago Enron was the darling of Wall Street, the poster boy for the uti=\nlity industry, its stock selling for about $85 a share. Last week its stock=\n was worth about 10 percent of that and the company had agreed to be bought=\n by a competitor. There was fear the company's bond rating might fall to th=\ne \"junk\" level.\nWhat happened? It will take months, if not years, to untangle the details, =\nbut it is clear that the main culprit was greed, closely followed by hubris=\n.=20\nNot too many years ago Enron was a small, struggling, gas pipeline company =\nin Houston. As deregulation spread to more and more states, Enron began acq=\nuiring pipelines, gas producers and utilities.=20\nIt also acquired friends in high places, especially the Bush family and the=\nir key political advisers. And, it discovered it could make money faster by=\n selling and trading energy than by producing it. Enron sold many of its ge=\nnerating plants and became the biggest \"power broker\" in the nation.=20\nThough it was by no means the largest winner in the con game that bilked Ca=\nlifornia consumers of tens of billions of dollars, Enron was one of the fir=\nst power barons to take advantage of California's flawed deregulation law -=\n- virtually written by in-state and out-of- state utility companies.=20\nThe California fiasco soured (probably) most Americans on utility deregulat=\nion, but Enron was not singled out for calumny, and management saw no reaso=\nn to examine its business ethics.=20\nContrarywise. management had visions of even greater profits, which it felt=\n no obligation to share with ordinary stockholders. The chief financial off=\nicer and other high-ranking executives set up affiliated or subsidiary part=\nnerships which made deals with Enron. I do not understand the details of th=\nese arrangements, but neither do independent accountants, the Securities an=\nd Exchange Commission or congressional investigators. It does seem clear th=\nat the Enron insiders made millions for themselves.=20\nEnron acknowledges, without explaining, that stockholder equity dropped $1.=\n2 billion in the last quarter and that it had for the last five years overs=\ntated profits by some $600 million. Whether this was by design or by mistak=\ne is in dispute, but it is the sort of thing which tends to undermine the c=\nonfidence of investors.=20\nSo much for greed. Back to hubris. It seems not unlikely that Enron's leade=\nrs felt they might not be punished for a modest amount of corner-cutting be=\ncause they had friends in high places.=20\nThe chief executive, Kenneth L. Lay, was and is a personal friend of George=\n W. Bush and has easy access to the White House. For many months after the =\nnew administration took office, Karl Rove, Bush's top political strategist,=\n owned Enron stock valued at $100,000 to $250,000, and sold it only after h=\ne had been able to secure a ruling that he did not have to pay capital gain=\ns tax immediately because he sold to avoid a conflict of interest. Lawrence=\n Lindsey, the president's chief economic coordinator, and I. Lewis Libby, V=\nice President Cheney's chief of staff, owned stock in Enron, and Lindsey wa=\ns paid $50,000 last year as a consultant for Enron.=20\nEnron and its employees gave more than anyone else to Bush's four political=\n campaigns -- one (unsuccessful) for Congress, two for governor and one for=\n president. In 2000, Enron and its employees gave $113,000 to Bush's campai=\ngn, $250,000 to the Republican National Committee, and $300,000 to the Pres=\nidential Inauguration Committee.=20\nCabinet appointments affecting energy policy, key sub-Cabinet appointments,=\n administration action or inaction in the California energy mess, and the o=\nverall energy policy of the administration could hardly have been more favo=\nrable to the interests of Enron.=20\nAnd now a couple of questions: Is it possible the unusual financial maneuve=\nrs by Enron went unnoticed or even unsuspected by all the savvy Texas oilme=\nn in the Bush administration? Were those of them with heavy investments in =\nEnron unconcerned about the conduct of the company? Was Enron right in thin=\nking its friends in government would not be in a hurry to investigate or to=\n reprimand?=20\nOr, in light of our preoccupation with terrorism, will the Enron case get m=\nuch attention from the federal government? Or from voters?=20\nWaldo Proffitt is the former editor of the Herald-Tribune.\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Even so, stocks will have to post strong gains in the next six weeks =\nto keep this from being the market's worst calendar year since 1977.=20\nThe blue-chip Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 1.6% last week, but it's sti=\nll down 13.8% year to date.=20\nYet those losses, while certainly not trivial (especially when they're your=\ns), can obscure what arguably are some very positive aspects of this year's=\n experiences.=20\nWith investing, adversity can be a more important teacher than success. If =\nyou're having trouble this Thanksgiving week finding reasons to be thankful=\n about anything investment-related, try these on for size:=20\n* \"Asset allocation\" is no longer just a quaint theory. The paramount inves=\nting rule has always been to spread your money around to reduce risk. But i=\nt took the worst stock bear market in 25 years to bring this lesson home fo=\nr many people who thought equities only rose in value.=20\nNow, millions of investors have a far better appreciation for just how much=\n they can lose in stocks--and how bonds and short-term cash savings can off=\nset market losses and preserve capital.=20\nIt has been a hard lesson, to be sure. But investors who take asset allocat=\nion to heart will be laying a much more solid foundation for their money in=\n the long run. And don't underestimate what that can mean for your peace of=\n mind long term.=20\n* The wisdom of saving money on a regular basis has been relearned. In the =\nlate 1990s, many economists lamented how the U.S. savings rate continued to=\n shrink. Some people felt there was little need to put significant new sums=\n into savings when the stocks or stock mutual funds they owned seemed to be=\n rising nonstop.=20\nIn other words, many Americans were letting the stock market do their savin=\ng for them when share prices were rising 20% or more each year.=20\nNow, with shares down and with the likelihood of much more moderate returns=\n on stocks in this decade, it's clear that many people will have to find a =\nway to save regularly if they're going to meet their long-term financial go=\nals, especially retirement.=20\nThis may not be a pleasant reality, but it's better for most people to have=\n faced this fact sooner rather than later, while there may be time to make =\nup lost ground.=20\n* A healthy skepticism has replaced mindless euphoria about stocks and thos=\ne who tout them. The market's slide has discredited a legion of Wall Street=\n analysts, money managers and others whose knowledge, understanding and jud=\ngment were clearly lacking, in retrospect.=20\nInvestors have come to see that having blind faith in those who present the=\nmselves as \"experts\" is a highly dangerous strategy, if it can be called a =\nstrategy at all.=20\nSure, it may have been more fun when technology stocks were shooting the mo=\non and nobody had much use for reviewing a company's fundamentals. But that=\n wasn't investing--it was speculating, and on a massive, and ultimately rui=\nnous, scale.=20\nPeople have learned to be less trusting about what others say about the mar=\nket, and that is more likely to be beneficial than detrimental to their por=\ntfolios in the long run.=20\nJust ask anyone who shifted their entire 401(k) retirement savings sum into=\n aggressive-growth mutual funds in the first quarter of 2000--right before =\nthe market peaked--because of the bullish comments of some 25-year-old tech=\n stock analyst. Those investors aren't likely to make a move like that agai=\nn.=20\n* Free-market forces are weeding out the weak players and the phonies. Capi=\ntalism may be harsh, but it's efficient when the good times end and it's ti=\nme to find out which companies truly have talent and staying power--and des=\nerve more capital.=20\nHundreds of dot-coms have failed, but who really misses them? Is it any har=\nder to find what you want on the Internet? It probably would have been much=\n worse for all concerned if those companies had sucked up investors' funds =\nfor another year instead of failing when they did.=20\nBut the market isn't just eliminating small companies that never had much o=\nf a future. The financial near-collapse of energy giant Enron Corp. exposed=\n a business that twisted accounting rules to its own benefit--to the point =\nthat the company now concedes that financial statements all the way back to=\n 1997 \"should not be relied upon.\"=20\nAlso to be weeded out, though over a longer time period, will be mutual fun=\nd managers whose performance running other peoples' money has been a nightm=\nare for those investors--meaning, the returns produced have been far worse =\nthan what the investors would have achieved in the average fund in that par=\nticular sector.=20\nThese managers know who they are--and, hopefully, their shareholders know b=\ny now as well, and will vote with their feet.=20\nThe free market also is reminding cartels just how tough it is to control p=\nrices.=20\nOnce again, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has lost its =\nability to prop up crude oil prices, which have sunk to two-year lows amid =\nthe weak global economy. That's lousy for OPEC, but it's great for every en=\nergy consumer.=20\n* The market's woes have altered many investors' priorities for the better.=\n The wild bull market of the late 1990s demanded peoples' attention, and go=\nt it.=20\nFor some, stocks became an obsession. Their portfolios dominated their live=\ns, especially if they were actively trading shares. They believed they were=\n going to be rich, or richer, and that it was all because of how smart they=\n were.=20\nNow, most people have been humbled by the market. In the process, some have=\n realized that they don't want their mood determined by their portfolio's d=\nay-to-date price changes.=20\nThe Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, of course, also changed many peoples' view =\nof what truly matters to them.=20\nMoney is important, but you aren't your stocks, and they aren't you.

Glassman\nDon't Be A Pudd'n'head, Diversify\nJames K. Glassman\n\n11/18/2001\nThe Washington Post\nFINAL\nH01\nCopyright 2001, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved\n\nWarren Buffett, who was probably the greatest investor of the 20th century,=\n is fond of quoting the salacious actress Mae West as saying, \"Too much of =\na good thing can be wonderful.\" In the market, such a motto would lead you =\nto avoid diversification and instead concentrate your portfolio in stocks y=\nou really, really like.=20\nPeter Lynch, who was probably the best mutual fund manager of the 20th cent=\nury, calls spreading yourself too thin \"diworseification.\"\nSmart, witty and brilliant at picking stocks, Buffett and Lynch may not nee=\nd diversification, but the rest of us do. When you own one stock, you're ou=\nt on a limb. For example, very few analysts -- with or without a conflict o=\nf interest -- predicted that shares of Enron, the energy and trading compan=\ny, would tumble by 90 percent in a year. Put all your eggs in a basket like=\n that and you end up with a gooey mess. The more stocks you own -- as long =\nas they are in different industries -- the more the overall riskiness of yo=\nur portfolio is modulated.=20\nThe reason you don't want a super-risky portfolio is simple: While Warren B=\nuffett may be calm and prescient enough to ride out severe dips in the valu=\ne of his holdings, most investors are not. A portfolio that increases in pr=\nice by 10 percent each and every year is worth exactly the same at the end =\nof three years as a portfolio that falls by half the first year, rises by t=\nhree-quarters the second and rises by 52 percent the third. But reasonable =\ninvestors prefer the consistent ride. It prevents them from doing something=\n stupid, such as selling all their stocks after losing half their money dur=\ning that first disastrous year.=20\nConsider the sad case of James D. McCall, who earlier this month resigned a=\ns manager of the Merrill Lynch Focus Twenty mutual fund. Two years ago, Mer=\nrill wanted McCall's services so desperately that the firm went to court to=\n pry McCall away from his previous employer, Pilgrim Baxter, where he rang =\nup impressive gains in the late 1990s. (His big success was called PBHG Lar=\nge Cap 20.) And when they got McCall, Merrill's brokers raised more than $1=\n.5 billion from their clients for him to invest. While the average growth-s=\ntock mutual fund owns about 100 stocks, with the top 10 holdings representi=\nng about one-fourth of the portfolio's total value, McCall specialized in w=\nhat are called \"concentrated portfolios.\" In the case of Merrill Lynch Focu=\ns Twenty, he owned, as the name implies, just 20 stocks. At last report, hi=\ns top 10 holdings accounted for a whopping two-thirds of the fund's assets.=\n=20\nIf McCall had spread his 20 stocks among, say, a dozen different industries=\n, he might have smoothed his ride. Instead, 69 percent of his assets went t=\no technology firms. The Focus fund and a smaller one that McCall ran called=\n Premier Growth were launched in March 2000. Within just 17 months, all but=\n $650 million of the clients' original $1.5 billion had vanished.=20\nIt is hard to imagine losing as much as Focus Twenty did even if you tried.=\n As of Nov. 9, the week McCall resigned, the fund was down 72 percent for t=\nhe year, compared with a loss of 14 percent for the Standard & Poor's 500-s=\ntock index, the benchmark for fund managers. According to the latest report=\n from Morningstar Mutual Funds, 19 of McCall's 20 stocks had declined durin=\ng 2001, the only exception being Harley-Davidson. More amazing, 16 of the 1=\n9 losers had fallen by at least half. (By the way, Enron was McCall's seven=\nth-largest holding.)=20\n\"This fund has had a wretched existence,\" wrote Morningstar analyst Kunal K=\napoor, who did admit a grudging admiration for McCall's perseverance. McCal=\nl's \"faith may turn out to be well placed over time,\" Kapoor said. Unfortun=\nately, time ran out.=20\nMy point here is not to pick on McCall but to reveal the perils of concentr=\nation. Buying Focus Twenty as a technology fund, and consigning it to no mo=\nre than one-fifth of your holdings (with the rest of your assets in diversi=\nfied, conventional stocks or funds) might have made sense, but Focus Twenty=\n was touted as a \"long-term capital appreciation\" fund, not a sector fund. =\nHere, it failed, but maybe it didn't have to.=20\nThe manager who made the concentrated fund popular, Tom Marsico, who ran Ja=\nnus Twenty, took care to spread his holdings around. His successor, Scott S=\nchoelzel, has suffered losses lately (he is down 28 percent year-to-date, b=\nut that's after a total gain of 546 percent in the preceding five years), b=\nut they have not been nearly so catastrophic -- and for good reason. Schoel=\nzel's last report lists among his top 10 holdings three tech stocks, two fi=\nnancials, one drug company, one energy firm (whoops, Enron again), one indu=\nstrial, one consumer-durables company and one services firm.=20\nFor investors in individual stocks, the important question is this: How muc=\nh diversification is enough? Some risk is inherent in even the broadest por=\ntfolio. This is called market, or \"systematic,\" risk. Over the past 75 year=\ns, market risk, as measured in standard deviation, has been about 20 percen=\nt. In other words, in two-thirds of the years the annual return of the S&P =\nhas fallen into a band ranging from 20 points lower to 20 points higher tha=\nn its average return of 11 percent; that is, between a loss of 9 percent an=\nd a gain of 31 percent. That's still volatile, but if you invest in stocks =\nyou have to live with it.=20\nWhat you don't have to live with is anything more volatile. So your objecti=\nve in building a portfolio is to try to approximate systematic risk and avo=\nid what is called \"idiosyncratic,\" or extra, risk. A portfolio with just a =\nfew stocks, or one like McCall's, that is overloaded in a single sector, ha=\ns lots of idiosyncratic risk. In 1977, an influential study found that inve=\nstors could nearly eliminate that extra risk by owning just 20 stocks in a =\nwide variety of sectors; in fact, owning eight or 10 stocks depressed risk =\nsharply.=20\nRecently, however, the market has appeared to be far more volatile, and a n=\new study by a group of economists headed by John Campbell of Harvard found =\nthat many more stocks were needed -- around 50 -- to bring a portfolio down=\n to the same level of riskiness as the broad market. What Campbell's group =\nfound was that neither the market itself nor individual sectors had become =\nmore volatile in the 1990s, but that stocks within those sectors had, so yo=\nu need to own more of them.=20\nBut owning 50 stocks is a pain in the neck -- and it brings up the Buffett-=\nLynch admonitions about too much diversification. It is hard just to take t=\nhe time to make the selections, but even buy-and-hold investors need to kee=\np track of the companies they own to spot adverse changes in management, pr=\noduct failures or new competition (not to mention Enron-style accounting sh=\nenanigans) -- signs that it's time to sell.=20\nOne good answer is to achieve balance by owning a combination of mutual fun=\nds and stocks. For example, you might want to put 50 percent of the money y=\nou have allotted for stocks into a fund that mimics the S&P itself, like Va=\nnguard Index 500, which charges rock-bottom expenses and guarantees that ri=\nsk won't exceed systematic levels. You could also consider a broad fund tha=\nt's managed by human beings, such as Meridian Value or Baron Growth, which =\nare recommended by Sheldon Jacobs, editor of the No-Load Fund Investor news=\nletter. Then another 25 percent of your holdings can go into a few sector f=\nunds that specialize in technology, real estate, energy and small-caps, and=\n the final 25 percent into a portfolio of 10 to 20 individual stocks. (I ow=\nn 16, at last count.)=20\nThere are many valid variations. Just don't emulate Mark Twain.=20\nIn a letter to clients recently, Anthony M. Maramarco of David L. Babson & =\nCo., the Cambridge, Mass., investment firm, recalled the aphorism of Twain'=\ns Pudd'n'head Wilson: \"Put all your eggs in the one basket -- and watch tha=\nt basket!\" Unfortunately, such a philosophy emphatically does not work in s=\ntock investing -- as Twain himself learned when he sank nearly all his fort=\nune into the Paige Linotype, a machine that flopped.=20\nWe all make mistakes. (It was Twain, after all, who pointed out that \"human=\n beings are the only animals that blush -- or need to.\") But smart diversif=\nication helps investors avoid some of the worst of them.=20\nJames K.

But don't bank on it.\nWhen corporate insiders can sell the company and stroll away with millions =\nwhile workers and other stockholders are left with peanuts, it would be har=\nd not to be bitter.=20\nAs Oregonian business writer Jeff Manning reported Friday, local employees =\nof Portland General Electric, an Enron subsidiary, watched their retirement=\n savings sink after Enron announced on Oct. 16 that it would lose $618 mill=\nion in the fourth quarter. This came after Enron officers made more than $1=\n36 million selling stocks earlier in the year.=20\nThen on Nov. 8, Enron dropped the other shoe: It admitted it had overstated=\n earnings for four years by $586 million, or 20 percent. Over those few wee=\nks, Enron shares plunged from $33.84 to its $9 close on Friday.=20\nThe four-year overstatement developed through some novel accounting methods=\n. Enron and its auditor, Arthur Anderson, insist that its financial reports=\n were all within proper standards, but the mechanics in this case included =\nobscuring debt by placing it on the ledgers of other entities so that the p=\narent company's profit picture appeared rosier than it actually was.=20\nThe weeks from mid-October to early November were wrenching for employees. =\nBecause the company was changing its fund manager, they were powerless to m=\nake any changes in their 401(k) plans. PGE chief executive Peggy Fowler poi=\nnts out that the change in 401(k) plan managers was announced last summer. =\nAnd although employees could have gotten out of Enron stocks over the histo=\nry of the plan, Enron seemed to be an attractive investment.=20\nCompany executives, though, were selling. Jeffrey Skilling, who was promote=\nd to Enron chief executive early in the year but resigned in August, sold m=\nore than $5 million in company shares according to transaction records cove=\nring the first half of the year.=20\nFormer chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, who was fired last month in =\nan action related to the financial mess, made $14 million in stock sales be=\ntweeen March and November of last year. Kenneth Lay, Enron's chief executiv=\ne, who returned after his protege Skilling left, made at least $20 million =\nin stock sales from late last year. He has announced that he would decline =\nhis severance package.=20\nDynegy, another Texas energy marketing company, has made a bid to buy Enron=\n. That probably means the best Enron and PGE employees can hope for now is =\nthat Dynegy will be a better corporate owner, or they can try their luck wi=\nth one of the many shareholder lawsuits being filed.=20\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating Enron's activities.=\n If its behavior was illegal, there will be consequences for company office=\nrs.=20\nThat's still not much to offer to workers who have seen their retirement sa=\nvings dissolve. But for now it's all there is.\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

All Rights Reserved\n\nFINANCE WEEK - From dealing to reeling - The legacy of the late 1990s stock=\n market bubble remains with us, as does irrationality THE LONG VIEW - BARRY=\n RILEY.=20\nOptimism is back. Stock markets around the globe have typically rallied by =\n20 per cent since rock bottom was reached on September 21. Only 9 per cent =\nof global fund managers believe equities will be lower in 12 months, accord=\ning to a Merrill Lynch survey published this week.\nBut the legacy of the late 1990s stock market bubble remains with us. The c=\nhallenge is how to minimise the level of irrationality. Two of the UK's big=\ngest losers from crazy prices reported on Tuesday. Vodafone suffered #11.45=\nbn of write-downs - but curiously, made no provisions against the sky-high =\n#13.1bn it paid for third-generation mobile phone licences in 2000.=20\nSuch payments, argued Sir Christopher Gent, Voda-fone's chief executive, we=\nre merely what the market demanded at the time. It is interesting to note, =\ntoo, that Paul Klemperer, the Oxford professor who is an expert in \"auction=\n theory\" and advised the British government, has defended the disastrous ou=\ntcome by arguing that the prices reflected the capital market's view of 3G'=\ns prospects. The common theme here is that it is nobody's fault if crazy pr=\nices are paid, because they are legitimised by the stock market.=20\nMarconi, which is financially in a much worse state than the mobile phone g=\niant, has written off most of the #4.1bn paid for US internet hardware comp=\nanies in 1999. There has also been a great deal of controversy in the US du=\nring the past few weeks over the near-collapse of Enron, the power group be=\ning rescued by a takeover bid from its smaller rival Dynegy. There was an o=\nbvious failure by investors - and by stock market analysts - to assess the =\ntrue risks at Enron.=20\nSmart businessmen will sellat mad prices, but why on earth should they buy?=\n The trouble is, too many academics have developed theories of value based =\non rational expectations. The real world is unfortunately very different.=\n=20\nSome of the distortions had obvious technical origins. The Vodafone bubble =\nof 1999 reflected the cross-border takeover of Mannesmann and the artificia=\nl weighting shortages that developed from that transaction as Vodafone ball=\nooned in market capitalisation to reach, at one stage, 16 per cent of the F=\nTSE 100 Index. The market price was driven not by normal corporate fundamen=\ntals, but by the desire of most fund managers to reach a market weighting, =\nat which point they were \"safe\" in terms of risk against the index benchmar=\nk.=20\nThat was the period when investment banks exploited the idea of low free-fl=\noat new issues: internet companies, especially, were floated off with only =\n15 per cent of the stock made available, although anything up to 100 per ce=\nnt went into the indices, creating serious shortages and bubble valuations.=\n Changes now being made to the main stock market indices have reduced the p=\nroblem, but there remains a basic irrationality in the concept that investm=\nent risk resides in an index rather than in the underlying stocks.=20\nTakeovers have always been plagued by irrationality, and indeed this is an =\narea where academics recognise the problem; over many years they have point=\ned out that all the benefits of deals, and often more than all, accrue to t=\nhe shareholders of the companies taken over, while investors in the bidding=\n companies suffer dilution. Investors know this, and in normal market condi=\ntions news of a takeover will depress the bidder's share price. But in a bu=\nbble market these prudent attitudes can be overwhelmed by euphoria, as well=\n as technical factors relating to demand by fund managers so that they can =\nmaintain their weightings when a bidder is spraying around large quantities=\n of new equity.=20\nAlso, it is irrational that many more deals are done when the stock market =\nis high than when it is low. Two years ago, companies such as Marconi were =\nengaged in buying sprees at daft prices. Now, when prices are much lower, h=\nardly any acquisitions are being made (and investment banks are dismissing =\nthousands of employees). An exception to the deal famine is gold mining, wh=\nich just happens to have been one of the stock market's strongest sectors t=\nhis year.=20\nAnother important source of irrationality has been the domination of stock =\nmarket analysis by the stockbroking offshoots of the investment banks. Over=\n recent years their earnings-per-share forecasts for the next calendar year=\n have been on average 8 per cent too high. This has not just been a mistake=\n; they have been paid to be over-optimistic. Admittedly, attempts are being=\n made to restructure the incentives here, as the embarrassed investment ban=\nks come under pressure from the regulators and the courts for their errors =\nof judgment during the bull market, but it remains to be seen whether much =\nwill really change.=20\nThe mystery is why anybody would take notice of these forecasts, and indeed=\n many professional investors do not. That Merrill survey, incidentally, sho=\nws that fund managers on average expect no more than 4 per cent earnings pe=\nr share growth over the next year, while the stockbrokers' analysts are sti=\nll clinging to the hope that it will be 15 per cent.=20\nA final source of distortion is the tendency of companies to offer their ex=\necutives the wrong sort of incentives. The ruin of Marconi may appear irrat=\nional, when multi-billion-pound acquisitions are being declared worthless a=\nfter only two years. But executives with lucrative stock option plans, whic=\nh pay off if their gambles go right, combined with golden goodbye and pensi=\non packages that are triggered if things go wrong, may well consider it per=\nfectly rational, from their viewpoint, to take much bigger risks than other=\n shareholders, or employees, would consider acceptable.=20\nMoreover, Sir Christopher Gent, shareholders of Vodafone will remember, rec=\neived a controversial #10m personal bonus last year for clinching the Manne=\nsmann takeover, a deal that requires #10bn of write-offs.=20\nIn normal market conditions the valuation of equities may be tolerably rati=\nonal, but in a bubble market the rules are thrown out of the window. Many i=\nnvestors certainly like the idea of getting rich quickly. That is why many =\npeople subscribe so keenly to national lotteries in which the chance of win=\nning is so small as to be not worth rational consideration.=20\nbarry.riley@ft.com.=20\n(c) Copyright Financial Times Ltd.

Investors worry that new disclosures, such as\npreviously unreported debt, might threaten Enron's credit rating\nand scuttle the merger, possibly pushing Enron into bankruptcy.\n\n     ``There's been so much skepticism about what Enron's\nliabilities are with these partnerships, I'm looking to quantify\nthis,'' said Glen Hilton, a fund manager at Montgomery Asset\nManagement LP, which holds Dynegy shares.\n\n     Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay admitted last week that failed\ninvestments and a loss of investor confidence forced the sale to\nDynegy, and he and other executives pledged to be more open with\ninvestors. Lay, 59, said last week he won't accept a severance\npackage of more than $60 million that he could have collected\nfollowing the takeover.\n\n     Enron shares fell 48 cents yesterday to $9. Dynegy fell\n$1.53, or 3.5 percent, to $42.47.\n\n                           Balance Sheet\n\n     Enron's third-quarter report, which had been expected last\nweek, was delayed by the Dynegy talks and a restatement of\nearnings, Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey McMahon said. Enron\nreduced net income for four years by a combined $586 million to\ninclude losses from affiliated partnerships.\n\n     Monday's filing, called a 10-Q, will include a balance sheet\nsummarizing assets and debts. Enron for years has omitted balance\nsheets, which the SEC requires as part of the 10-Q, from its press\nreleases announcing earnings.\n\n     Investors renewed their criticisms of the practice after Lay\nmentioned during a conference call last month that dealings with\ntwo partnerships had reduced Enron's shareholder equity, or its\nassets minus liabilities, by $1.2 billion. The disclosure led to\nthe ouster of Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow.\n\n     ``Everyone is trying to make their own assessment of what\n(Enron's) ultimate liability will need to be,'' said Commerzbank\nSecurities analyst Andre Meade, who rates the shares ``hold'' and\ndoesn't own them.\n\n     Monday's report probably won't give a complete answer, said\nLouis Gagliardi, an analyst at John S. Herold Inc. While the\nbalance sheet will list liabilities for the partnerships, which\nwere set up to buy Enron assets and get debt off the company's\nbooks, it won't spell out Enron's share, he said.\n\n     ``What is the net liability off the balance sheet?''\nGagliardi said. ``We really don't know what that number is.''\n\n                           Credit Rating\n\n     Dynegy has said it can back out of the acquisition if Enron's\nlegal liabilities exceed $3.5 billion. The balance sheet ``will\nhelp us see how good a deal this is for Dynegy,'' said Kathleen\nVuchetich, co-manager of the $1.4 billion Strong American\nUtilities Fund, which owns 284,000 Dynegy shares.\n\n     Both companies are based in Houston.\n\n     The filing also might offer details on the SEC probe. ``It\nmay say what the SEC is looking for, and what the rating agencies\nhave told them,'' said Christopher Ellinghaus, an analyst at\nWilliams Capital Group. He added, though, ``I don't expect much.''\n\n     Enron's stock drop led Moody's Investors Service to cut the\ncompany's debt rating to the lowest investment grade. Dynegy held\noff on a purchase agreement out of concern that the rating would\nbe cut to junk, jeopardizing Enron's ability to raise cash needed\nto settle its daily power and natural-gas trades.\n\n     Enron may reveal where it expects to cut jobs and how much it\nwill pay to departing employees, Paik said. Chief Operating\nOfficer Greg Whalley said last week that fourth-quarter profit\nwill be hurt by severance payments and reorganization costs. He\ndidn't give details.\n\n     Jobs likely will be eliminated in businesses the company\nplans to sell, including its money-losing telecommunications unit\nand operations in Europe, analysts said.\n\n     Enron has about 21,000 employees, two-thirds in the U.S. and\nabout a fifth in the U.K. Its 600 traders are divided between\nLondon and Houston, where Enron employs about 7,500.\n\n     Many Enron workers are already preparing for layoffs, said\nLyndon Taylor, a Houston-based recruiter for Heidrick & Struggles\nInternational Inc., an executive placement firm.\n\n     ``I got 56 resumes last week from Enron,'' Taylor said.\n``That's equal to the number I got in the past year.''\n\n--Margot Habiby in Dallas and Jim Polson in Princeton\n\n\n\nUK: Trade, bank buyers circle Enron's Wessex Water-reports.\n\n11/17/2001\nReuters English News Service\n(C) Reuters Limited 2001.\n\nLONDON, Nov 17 (Reuters) - Both financial and trade buyers are considering =\nbids for Wessex Water, the UK utility owned by crisis-hit U.S. energy group=\n Enron , weekend press reports said.=20\nAccording to the UK trade magazine Utility Week, Enron's rescue buyer Dyneg=\ny wants to offload Wessex as soon as possible, and focus on integrating Enr=\non's core energy businesses.\nA report in the Sunday Telegraph newspaper named German bank WestLB as a po=\nssible buyer at a price of 1 billion pounds ($1.4 billion).

Offsetting factors include access to health care, clean ai=\nr, a short commute to work and the nearby mountain playground, which tend t=\no be important to affluent people.=20\nU.S. oil types may have strange accents -- many come from the southern stat=\nes -- but oilpatch jargon is pretty much the same.

They then require you to fill ou=\nt forms accounting for the missing cows.=20\nAMERICAN DEMOCRACY The government promises to give you two cows if you vote=\n for it. After the election, the President is impeached for speculating in =\ncow futures. The press dubs the affair \"cowgate,\" but supports the Presiden=\nt. The cows sue you for breach of contract. Your legal bills exceed your an=\nnual income. You settle out of court and declare bankruptcy.=20\nCAPITALISM You have two cows. You sell one and buy a bull. Your herd multip=\nlies and the economy grows. You sell them and retire on the income.=20\nENRON VENTURE CAPITALISM You have two cows. You sell three of them to your =\npublicly listed company, using letters of credit opened by your brother-in-=\nlaw at the bank, then execute a debt/equity swap with an associated general=\n offer so you get all four cows back, with a tax exemption for five cows. T=\nhe milk rights of the six cows are transferred via an intermediary to a Cay=\nman Island company secretly owned by the majority shareholder who sells the=\n rights to all seven cows back to your listed company. The annual report sa=\nys the company owns eight cows, with an option on one more.\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. =09\n\nWestLB Offers to Buy Enron's U.K. Water Unit, Newspaper Says\n2001-11-17 20:01 (New York)\n\n\n     London, Nov. 18 (Bloomberg) -- Westdeutsche Landesbank\nGirozentrale, Germany's largest state-owned bank, is one of\nseveral suitors talking to Enron Corp. about its Wessex Water\nunit, which is valued at more than 1 billion pounds ($1.4\nbillion), the Sunday Telegraph said without citing sources.\n\n     Dynegy Inc. of the U.S. is looking to buy Enron for $24\nbillion, and will sell some of its assets, including Wessex.\nWestLB made a formal offer to Enron in the past few days in hopes\nof striking a quick deal because Dynegy may want to avoid the\nregulatory risk in such a sale; any bid for a water company in the\nU.K. worth at least 30 million pounds must be referred to the\nCompetition Commission, the newspaper said.\n\n     Enron bought Wessex for 1.4 billion pounds in 1998. RWE AG of\nGermany, Europe's fourth-biggest power company, is also interested\nin Wessex, but Enron thinks U.K. regulators won't approve an RWE\nbid because the company already owns Thames Water, a large U.K.\nwater company.\n\n     WestLB has also been reported to be preparing a buyout for\nRailtrack Group Plc, the insolvent owner of the U.K.'s train\ntracks and stations, the paper said.\n\n\nEnron Closes on $550 Million Loan From J.P. Morgan, Salomon\n2001-11-16 17:36 (New York)\n\nEnron Closes on $550 Million Loan From J.P. Morgan, Salomon\n\n     Houston, Nov. 16 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. closed Wednesday\non a $550 million loan from J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Salomon\nSmith Barney Inc. that was secured with assets of its Transwestern\nPipeline Co., spokesman Vance Meyer said.\n\n     Enron, the largest energy trader, said Nov. 1 that it had\nreceived a commitment for $1 billion in loans from the investment\nbanks that would be used for debt payments and to supplement cash\nreserves.\n\n     Enron secured the loans with the assets of Transwestern and\nthe Northern Natural Gas Co. The two pipeline systems combined are\nabout 19,000 miles long and can deliver as much as 6 billion cubic\nfeet of gas a day. The remaining $450 million loan, secured with\nthe Northern Natural Gas assets, is in the documentation stage and\nis expected to close next week, Meyer said.\n\n     Enron agreed a week ago to be acquired by Dynegy Inc. in a\ntransaction now valued at $24.7 billion in stock and assumed debt.\nThe move followed a loss in investor confidence -- the company's\nshares had fallen 90 percent this year -- and amid a federal\ninvestigation of accounting irregularities that limited its\nability to finance operations.\n\n     ChevronTexaco Corp., the second-biggest U.S. oil company and\nDynegy's largest shareholder with 26 percent, provided Enron,\nthrough Dynegy, with a $1.5 billion cash infusion on Tuesday as\npart of the buyout agreement.\n\n     In return, Dynegy acquired preferred stock and other rights\nin the Enron unit that owns Northern Natural Gas. If the merger\nisn't completed, Dynegy will have the right to acquire Northern\nNatural Gas, Enron said in regulatory filing Wednesday.\nChevronTexaco will provide Dynegy with another $1 billion after\nthe merger closes to maintain its equity stake.\n\n     The shares of Enron fell 48 cents to $9, while shares of\nDynegy fell $1.53 to $42.47. Both companies are based in Houston.\nShares of San Francisco-based ChevronTexaco fell 35 cents to\n$83.45.\n\n--Margot Habiby in the Dallas newsroom (214) 954-9452\n"

New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels.

Morgan has been advising\nEnron on its merger with Dynegy.\n\n     Enron said yesterday it may have to pay $9.15 billion in debt\ndue by 2003, suggesting the company may run out of cash before the\nmerger closes. Dynegy has said the merger should close before the\nend of the third quarter of 2002.\n\n      Enron said in a regulatory filing that it has less than $2\nbillion in cash or credit lines.\n\n     Shares of Enron, the most active stock in U.S. trading, fell\n$1.79, or 23 percent, to $5.20 in midday trading. Before the\nannouncement that it had renegotiated the $690 million note, its\nshares had fallen as much as 42.78 percent, the lowest level in\nmore than a decade.\n\n     Dynegy fell $2.50, or 6 percent, to $39.20. Shares of\nChevronTexaco Corp., which owns 26 percent of Dynegy, rose 49\ncents to  $87.02\n\n\n\nEnron, Dynegy Shares Fall 2nd Day on Threat to Buyout (Update2)\n2001-11-21 11:49 (New York)\n\nEnron, Dynegy Shares Fall 2nd Day on Threat to Buyout (Update2)\n\n     (Adds analyst comment in fourth paragraph.)\n\n     Houston, Nov. 21, (Bloomberg) -- Shares of Enron Corp., the\nbiggest energy trader, and Dynegy Inc. fell for a second day on\nconcern Enron may run out of cash before its takeover by Dynegy\ncan be completed.\n\n     Enron tumbled as much as 33 percent, and Dynegy dropped as\nmuch as 6.7 percent. Enron's bonds also fell. The company's 6.4\npercent notes maturing in July 2006 were bid at 62 cents and\noffered at 66 cents, traders said. They sold at about 72 cents\nyesterday.\n\n     Institutional investors sold shares of both companies after\nGoldman, Sachs & Co. analyst David Fleischer downgraded them to\n``market perform'' from his ``recommend'' list, other analysts\nsaid.\n\n     The Dynegy bid ``did not eliminate customer concerns about\nEnron's liquidity and long-term viability,'' Goldman Sachs said\nin its report. ``We now believe that it will be difficult for\nEnron shares to generate strong returns until it is clear that\nEnron can operate on a normal basis without having to provide\ncash or letters of credit to back routine transactions.''\n\n     Fleischer also cut his 2002 profit estimate for Enron to 50\ncents from $1.35. Enron had been expected to make $1.90 next\nyear, the average estimate of 16 analysts surveyed by Thomson\nFinancial/First Call.\n\n     Enron said Monday it may have to pay $9.15 billion in debt\ndue by 2003, suggesting the Houston-based energy trader may run\nout of cash. The company said in a regulatory filing it has less\nthan $2 billion in cash or credit lines.\n\n     It also surprised some investors by saying a drop in its\ncredit rating may force it to repay a $690 million note next\nweek. Enron said yesterday the terms of the notes, which it\nguaranteed for an affiliated partnership that owns Brazilian\nnatural-gas assets, are being renegotiated and that it had a\n``verbal indications'' that the maturity of the notes will be\nextended.\n\n     The company's dealings with affiliated partnerships led to\nearnings restatements, credit-rating cuts, a federal\ninvestigation and a management shakeup. Dynegy plans to complete\nits buyout by October, and Enron may have to ask lenders to\nrestructure payment schedules.\n\n     Mirant Corp., Aquila Inc. and other big energy traders are\ndoing fewer transactions with Enron as concerns increase about\nits credit rating and ability to finance daily business,\nexecutives said yesterday.\n\n     Enron's stock fell $2.28, or 32 percent, to $4.71 in\nlate-morning trading. Earlier, it touched $4.67, its lowest price\nin more than a decade. The shares have plummeted 92 percent this\nyear. Dynegy fell $2.70, or 6.5 percent, to $39.00. The shares\nhad dropped 26 percent this year.\n\n\n\nU.S. Equity Movers: Cardiac Science, Enron, Guidant, TriQuint\n2001-11-21 10:24 (New York)\n\nU.S. Equity Movers: Cardiac Science, Enron, Guidant, TriQuint\n\n     New York, Nov. 21 (Bloomberg) -- The following is a list of\ncompanies whose shares are moving in U.S. markets Wednesday, Nov.\n21.

An Enron collapse would cause weeks=\n of dislocation in the energy markets that would damage other energy trader=\ns, and it would cause big losses for the Houston company's creditors.=20\nJust before noon EST, Enron announced in a press release that it had extend=\ned to mid-December a $690 million obligation that was due next week. It als=\no said that it had agreed with its bankers to draw down the remaining $450 =\nmillion of a previously announced $1 billion secured credit line that has J=\n.P. Morgan Chase as its lead banker.=20\nInvestors have been fleeing Enron since the company last month disclosed a =\n$1.2 billion writedown to unwind some related-party hedging transactions. T=\nhe Securities and Exchange Commission is probing Enron deals with related p=\narties. The October disclosure made investors uneasy because it suggested t=\nhe company hadn't been forthcoming about the true state of its finances, an=\nd it showed that Enron was facing serious liquidity problems.=20\nThose fears were temporarily quieted earlier this month when Enron agreed t=\no be acquired by smaller rival Dynegy. But Enron's disclosure Monday that i=\nt faces additional earnings and financing troubles renewed the rush to the =\nexits. In the Wednesday release, Enron CEO Ken Lay said his company was sti=\nll committed to the merger: \"We continue to believe that this merger is in =\nthe best interests of our shareholders, employees and lenders.\" Dynegy late=\nr issued a press release indicating it is \"continuing our confirmatory due =\ndiligence\" regarding the merger. Neither Enron nor Dynegy returned calls se=\neking comment.=20\nAfter plunging 23% Tuesday to $6.99, Enron was down a staggering 34% at one=\n point Wednesday. It moved slightly higher after the midday press release t=\no trade at $4.90. Enron shares have lost more than 80% of their value since=\n the company issued its third-quarter earnings release last month. Dynegy d=\nropped $2.44, to $39.26, though it remains substantially above premerger le=\nvels.=20\nAt the heart of Enron's trouble is the sense that the company isn't letting=\n on the full extent of its troubles. The selloff in Enron shares began in e=\narnest Oct. 16, when the company disclosed in an earnings conference call t=\nhat it would take a $1.2 billion writedown to unwind some related-party tra=\nnsactions. Critics of the company said those deals, in which the company di=\nd business with separate entities involving Enron managers, raised serious =\nethical and disclosure issues.=20\nThe Dynegy merger was taken as a vote of confidence for Enron, since as a b=\nig trading partner Dynegy would appear to have a solid grasp of Enron's sit=\nuation. As a result, shares in both companies rallied after the deal's anno=\nuncement. But Monday's disclosure that Enron faced $690 million in bond pay=\nments next week reignited worries that the company faced steeper challenges=\n than it has detailed. According to a Merrill Lynch report cited in The New=\n York Times Wednesday, Dynegy wasn't aware of the $690 million obligation. =\nCritics of the deal wondered whether Enron had told Dynegy about all its ob=\nligations. <http://www.thestreet.com/markets/detox/10003860.html>=20\nLiquidity fears have also been rekindled by information contained in a fili=\nng of quarterly results that show the company consumed as much as $5 billio=\nn of cash in recent weeks. By the end of 2002, Enron has to find around $9 =\nbillion to pay back various obligations. It had $1.2 billion in cash on han=\nd as of Nov. 16, according to the filing.=20\nTellingly, Dynegy shares haven't plunged along with Enron, suggesting that =\ninvestors see a collapse of the merger as catastrophic for Enron but not fo=\nr Dynegy. At current levels, Enron shares are trading at more than a 50% di=\nscount to the Dynegy offer.=20\nJ.P. Morgan has taken a leading role in helping Enron. It has lent funds an=\nd it helped restructure the $690 million obligation. The bank's stock was d=\nown 78 cents to $38.62. \"We will work with Enron and its other primary lend=\ners to develop a plan to strengthen Enron's financial position up to and th=\nrough its merger with Dynegy,\" said James Lee, a top banker at Morgan, in t=\nhe Enron release.=20\n\nFrom CBS.MarketWatch.com, online at:\n\nDYNEGY, ENRON SAY MERGER TO PROCEED\n\nBy Myra P. Saefong\n\n1:52 PM ET Nov 21, 2001\n\nWASHINGTON (CBS.MW) -- Merger partners Enron and Dynegy restated their\ncommitment Wednesday to completing a deal, on the heels of embattled\nEnron's announcement that its lead lender granted it more time to pay\noff a $690 million note set to come due next week.\n\n\"We are continuing our confirmatory due diligence and working to\naccelerate the regulatory approvals required to complete the merger,\"\nsaid Chuck Watson, Dynegy's chairman and chief executive,  in a\nstatement.\n\nShares of Enron (ENE) recovered slightly in afternoon  trading but\nremained under pressure.\n\n\nOn heavy volume, the stock -- which had touched $4 earlier in the\nsession -- was down $1.83 to trade at $5.16, a new 10-year low. Some 84\nmillion shares had changed hands.\n\nEnron declined 23 percent Tuesday after the company revealed the\nupcoming debt deadline and restated its earnings.\n\nMeanwhile, Dynegy shares lost $1.83 to stand at $39.87.\n\nEnron said that the lead bank on the $690 million debt agreed to extend\nthe maturity date to mid-December, which will give the company time to\nrestructure the facility, and added it expects to further restructure\nits debt.\n\n\"We ... believe we can identify a mutually beneficial restructuring to\nenhance our cash position, strengthen our balance sheet, and address\nupcoming maturities,\" said Jeff McMahon, chief financial officer, in a\nstatement.\n\nJ.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. said it and other lenders are committed to\nhelping Enron improve its financial position.\n\nAlso, Enron reaffirmed its commitment to a merger with Dynegy and said\nit closed on a previously announced $450 million line of credit from\nJ.P. Morgan, collateralized by the company's Northern Natural Gas Co.\n\nEnron -- which is being acquired by its smaller rival Dynegy (DYN) at a\nfire-sale price -- revealed in a Securities and Exchange Commission\nfiling Monday that it had to pay off or refinance $690 million in debt\nobligations by next Monday or risk triggering nearly $4 billion in\nadditional payments.\n\nIf Enron had missed that deadline and didn't post collateral, investors\nhad the right to demand immediate liquidation of the assets of one of\nEnron's limited partnerships, the unusual business entities at the\ncenter of the company's murky transactions currently under\ninvestigation.\n\nThe SEC filing of Monday also contained yet another restatement of\nfinancial results on the heels of a similar filing that disclosed more\nthan four years of restated earnings figures.\n<http://cbs.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?guid=3D%7B35D690E0%2D13BE%2D43D9=\n%2D9644%2D1B1CF4896115%7D>\n\nEarlier Wednesday, Goldman Sachs lowered its rating on Enron's stock to\n\"market performer\" from its \"U.S. recommended list,\" citing \"major\"\nliquidity issues and concerns over whether the company can recover the\nbusiness it has lost.\n\nCIBC World Markets also cut Enron to a \"hold\" from a \"buy.\"\n\nCommerzbank weighed in Wednesday, saying Enron's viability is in doubt.\n\n\"We believe the filing clearly shows that Enron remains in a precarious\nfinancial position and its status as a going concern is much in doubt,\"\nanalysts Andre Meade and Andrew Smith wrote. \"It appears that Enron's\nsituation could worsen in a number of ways.\"\n\nThough Enron's most recent disclosures shed more light on the fiscal\nsituation, Meade and Smith characterized the information as \"piecemeal.\"\n\n\"It appears that the full extent of Enron's problems is not currently\nknown,\" they said in a note, cautioning clients against investing in\nEnron.\n\n\n\n\n"

Some will return next month, others will be entirely fresh for November.\n\n1) Armchair Midfielder (MLS Playoffs)\n2) Word Association (w/ MNT defender Jeff Agoos)\n3) At the Movies (w/ U-17 MNT defenders Chris Lancos and Gray Griffin)\n4) Queries and Anecdotes (w/ WNT midfielder Julie Foudy)\n5) Big Woman on Campus (w/ WNT/U-21 WNT midfielder Aleisha Cramer)\n6) Superstar!!! (w/ WNT forward Tiffeny Milbrett)\n7) Mark That Calendar (2001 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup)\n8) Point-Counterpoint (w/ journalists Jere Longman and Steve Davis)\n9) From the Bleachers (w/ PHILIPS chant contest winner Randal Bird)\n10) \"You Don't Know Jack (Marshall)\" (U.S. Open Cup history)\n\n1) ARMCHAIR MIDFIELDER\nA monthly column about the State of Soccer, from the world game to Team America to pro soccer in the good &#8216;ole U-S-of-A, all with a healthy dose of cynicism.\n\nThis month, the Armchair Midfielder will handicap the second round of the MLS playoffs and go on record with a pick for MLS Cup 2001 champion.\n\nSo the defending champs are gone, and with them went their blase brand of defensive-minded soccer. MLS Cup will not be \"Goin' to Kansas City\" this year.  And let's face it, we as soccer fans are all better off with the Wizards watching the final from an Irish pub in downtown K.C.\n\nInstead, we get a classic (okay, the word is a bit of a leap considering MLS is just a toddler) match-up between the Galaxy and the Fire. Here are two teams that have been good every year that they've been in MLS. Sure, they've each had their ups and downs, but you can always count on them to play attractive soccer.\n\nContinue: http://www.ussoccer.com/news/fullstory.sps?iNewsid=2462\n\n\"BEHIND CLOSED DOORS\"\nA section that will let you get to know the real personalities of your favorite Men's, Women's and Youth National team players through various funny and unique first-person accounts. In this issue, you'll find:\n\n2)  \"WORD ASSOCIATION\" (w/ Jeff Agoos)\nJeff Agoos may or may not need some sort of therapy. Regardless, with 25 prompts on topics both easy and tough, we play psychiatrist to get a candid look inside the mind of San Jose Earthquakes star Jeff Agoos, one of the most accomplished defenders and one of the most enduring personalities in U.S. Soccer history.\n\n\"Goose\" has been a member of the U.S. Men's National Team program since 1985 and has the rare distinction of being the only men's player to compete on every major national team level offered by U.S. Soccer (U-15, U-17, U-20, Olympic, full Men's National Team and ... that's right, the game everyone loves to ignore ... Futsal). The 33-year-old veteran has won championships both at the college (at the Univ. of Virginia) and pro (D.C. United of MLS) levels and is currently being counted on to help the U.S. Men qualify for the 2002 World Cup after missing out on chances to play in both the 1994 and 1998 World Cups.\n\nPrompt ... Response\nDallas ... Home\nMusic ... Rock n' roll\nPony Tail ... Goose\nStyle ... Armani\nBora Milutinovic [MNT coach 1991-95] ... Teacher\nSteve Sampson [MNT coach 1995-98] ... No comment\nBruce Arena [current MNT coach] ... Winner, motivator\n\nContinue: http://www.ussoccer.com/news/fullstory.sps?iNewsid=2463\n\n3) \"AT THE MOVIES\" (w/ U-17s Chris Lancos and Gray Griffin)\nWhat to do between meals and training and meals and light out? For any and all of those that have been called into a U.S. National Team camp, the answer is: see a movie.\n\nPerhaps no U.S. team sees more movies than those precocious teenagers from the U.S. Under-17 Men's National team. Strip mall cinema connoisseurs Chris Lancos and Gray Griffin recount summer blockbuster \"American Pie 2\", a shining beacon of good taste and sophisticated humor. It should be noted that both players were accompanied by an adult (most likely U-17 MNT head coach John Ellinger or goalkeeper coach Peter Mellor) to the viewing of the aforementioned movie.\n\nChris Lancos, U.S. U-17 defender and native of Belford, N.J.: \"Gotta admit it &#8211; I'm a big fan of the first American Pie.  Great movie &#8211; one of the funniest I have seen in a while. So I went in with high hopes for the second one... \"\n\nGray Griffin, U.S. U-17 captain/defender and native of Huntersville, N.C.: \"GREAT MOVIE!  Without a doubt, you need to see it if you haven't seen it.  I've seen it twice... \"\n\nContinue: http://www.ussoccer.com/news/fullstory.sps?iNewsid=2464\n\n4) \"QUERIES AND ANECDOTES\" (w/ Julie Foudy)\nOff-the-wall Questions and Answers, Queries and Anecdotes from the veteran U.S. WNT captain and jokester herself\n\nCenter Circle: Who's your favorite superhero and why?\nJulie Foudy: \"It has to be Spiderman.  Simply because I love the Spiderman theme song and I like to think I move across the field with the speed, agility and grace of a spider.  Then I woke up.\"\n\nCC: What's your biggest brush with greatness, meaning, who's the biggest celebrity you've met?\nJF: \"Aside from Mia Hamm, who doubles as my caddy for her second job, I'd have to say Socks, the White House feline.  Socks was extremely hospitable and chatty, and made my White House experience very enjoyable.\"\n\nCC: If you were a cartoon character, who would you be? (And why?)\nJF: \"Scooby Doo, because he always gets to eat.\"\n\nCC: Is there a better city than San Diego?\nJF: \"If you can find me a place where the sun shines about 360 days a year and the temperature stays in the range of 65-85 degrees 12 months a year, you have blue water and sandy beaches and the greatest soccer fans in the WUSA, then maybe.  But I doubt it.\"\n\nContinue: http://www.ussoccer.com/news/fullstory.sps?iNewsid=2465\n\n5) \"BIG WOMAN ON CAMPUS\" (w/ Aleisha Cramer)\nA monthly \"How's School?\" report from the campus of one of the many players on U.S. Youth National Teams who finds themselves cramming for exams in between U.S. training camps.\n\nThis month, we get a page from the journal of BYU sophomore and Lakewood, Colo., native Aleisha Cramer, the U.S. Under-21 WNT veteran and rising star on the full U.S. Women's National Team.\n\nIf you've ever been to Provo, Utah, you probably know that there is not a heck of a lot do.  But after over a year at BYU, I am starting to realize that the city and surrounding area has a lot to offer -- you just have to be creative.\n\nStill, most of my time during the college season is spent on the soccer field, traveling to the soccer field or coming back from the soccer field.  Oh yeah, our coach Jen Rockwood likes to have a lot of meetings too.  Basically, most of my day is taken by soccer and studying.\n\nBut despite all the time dedicated to soccer, believe it or not, I do have a social life and I'm really enjoying college.  I have a great group of friends and we always have fun.  The coolest thing is that we have fun just doing nothing.  It's amazing that we can laugh as much as we do just hanging out.\n\nContinue: http://www.ussoccer.com/news/fullstory.sps?iNewsid=2466\n\n6) \"SUPERSTAR!!!\" (w/ Tiffeny Milbrett)\nA monthly feature about a U.S. Men's, Women's or Youth National Team player from the U.S. Soccer Communications Department.\n\nThis month, we turn the big spotlight on all 5 feet 2 inches of superstar U.S. Women's National Team forward and WUSA Most Valuable Player Tiffeny Milbrett.\n\n\"Without Time For a Pit Stop, Forward Tiffeny Milbrett Powers Her Way to WUSA MVP Honors\"\n\nLike many young and successful professional athletes, Tiffeny Milbrett owns two cars.  And like many who love their cars, they reflect the owner in many ways.\n\nThe first, a jet-black 2001 Chevrolet S10 4x4 pickup truck, which Milbrett received for being named the 2000 U.S. Soccer Chevrolet Female Player of the Year.  (She upgraded from a four-door.  Not her style). The truck represents the ruggedness of the five-foot-two Milbrett, who despite her small stature, has scored 86 career international goals, good for sixth best in world history.  It also represents the outdoors woman and adventurer that she is, a small-town Oregon girl who loves nature and travel, and who spent a good part of three years of her life in Japan playing professional soccer.\n\nHer other car is a gleaming, silver 2000 Audi S4 sports car is unique, sleek and does zero-to-60 in nothing flat.  With 275 horsepower, it darts past other cars, takes curves like it was on rails and looks good doing it.  It can go as fast as 165 miles an hour (Note to Oregon Highway Patrol: Tiffeny has never taken it that fast, as far as you know).\n\nMilbrett drives it like she plays, at a few gears higher than the rest, and hell-bent to get where she is going, which is usually the goal, a journey that is almost always successful.\n\nContinue: http://www.ussoccer.com/news/fullstory.sps?iNewsid=2467\n\n7) \"MARK THAT CALENDAR\" (2001 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup Final)\nA stern reminder about an upcoming U.S. Soccer event, whether you plan to check it out live and in person or on the tube.\n\nOctober has always been known for three things: Fall foliage, Halloween, and the abrupt cancellation of weak new TV shows like \"Emeril!\" (How bad can 22 minutes of entertainment be?) or another lame \"Seinfeld\" spinoff (Note to Michael Richards: Kramer's only funny in small doses). But for soccer fans, it's all about championship soccer. For U.S. Soccer, that championship is the 2001 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup, American soccer's oldest tournament.\n\nThis year's title match is a first for both the Los Angeles Galaxy and the New England Revolution when it comes to the 88-year-old annual competition, which is open to all teams (amateur or pro) affiliated with U.S. Soccer and has made its mark as a ripe ground for inter-league upsets of David vs. Goliath.\n\nContinue: http://www.ussoccer.com/news/fullstory.sps?iNewsid=2468\n\n8) \"POINT-COUNTERPOINT\" (w/ journalists Jere Longman and Steve Davis)\nEvery month, we'll pose a question or make a statement about something in soccer that will be debated on by two individuals from the same walk of life. Be it a coach, player, general manager, the two will each give their side of the story, so to speak.\n\nIn this case, we've enlisted the help of two soccer journalists. In one corner, wearing a Mia Hamm replica jersey under his shirt and blue blazer ... Jere Longman, who covers international sport and the Olympics for the New York Times and whose extensive coverage of the 1999 Women's World Cup turned into a book about the U.S. Women's National Team entitled \"The Girls of Summer.\" In the other corner, wearing a worn-out replica of the now infamous U.S. Men's \"denim star\" jersey ... Steve Davis, a general columnist who's also been covering soccer for The Dallas Morning-News for over a decade and has covered the last two Men's World Cups.\n\nThis month's question: What event had a greater impact on soccer in the United States: World Cup &#8216;94 or Women's World Cup &#8216;99?\n\nJere Longman, pro-WWC99:\nIt is indisputable that the 1999 Women's World Cup had a greater impact on soccer in the United States than the 1994 men's World Cup.\n\nThe Women's World Cup produced an American champion, and the American public loves a winner. In three weeks, without benefit of lavish pre-game shows or newspaper special sections, the Women's World Cup built a galvanizing momentum. It went from almost zero on the public radar to a consuming moment that drew over 90,000 fans to the final match against China at the Rose Bowl and attracted 40 million television viewers...\n\nSteve Davis, pro-WC94:\nBack in the early 1990s, soccer was like the puny kid in junior high: lots of potential, plenty of good things ahead ... but still the last one picked for the team and having some trouble fitting in.\n\nWorld Cup 1994 changed all that. It was international soccer's coming out party in the United States. A land that respects the big event, the colossal show, began to see soccer as a sport it could learn to like.\n\nFor soccer fans, it was their moment in the sun. More importantly in the big picture, Americans who wouldn't know a corner kick from a corner market tuned in to see what the fuss was about. Until the United States wins a World Cup, nothing else will be more influential in elevating the sport's domestic profile.\n\nContinue: http://www.ussoccer.com/news/fullstory.sps?iNewsid=2469\n\n9) \"FROM THE BLEACHERS\" (w/ PHILIPS Chant Contest winner Randal Bird)\nA monthly look at the fans behind the U.S. National Teams. In this case, one special fan by the name of Randal Bird has gone and made himself part of U.S. Soccer history as the author of the contest-winning Philips/U.S. Soccer chant that will hopefully be a part of international matches for years to come.\n\nGOALS! GOALS! GOALS! Chanting to Your Heart's Content\n\nWhen Philips Electronics joined U.S. Soccer in a partnership to help promote and develop the sport of soccer in the United States last June, their first order of business was launching a unique \"chant\" contest to challenge U.S. Soccer fans from all over the globe to log on to www.ussoccer.com and begin chanting to their hearts content.\n\nOf course, choosing a winning chant for which hundreds of fans would eventually be asked to latch on to as their own was never going to be easy.  Fans come in all different shapes and sizes.  And so do stadium chants.\n\n>From the long and melodic melodies of \"We all root for the red soccer team, the red soccer team, the red soccer team\" (as sung to the lyrics of Yellow Submarine) to the less melodic but rhythmic eloquence of a European chant like \"Stand up, if you hate Man U. ...  Stand up, if you hate Man U.\", they each have their own charm.\n\nContinue: http://www.ussoccer.com/news/fullstory.sps?iNewsid=2470\n\n10) \"YOU DON'T KNOW JACK (MARSHALL)\" (U.S. Open Cup history)\nThink you know your U.S. Soccer trivia? Well...try us. We'll see how far back your knowledge of Team USA and U.S. Soccer extends. And who the heck is Jack Marshall? Even the trivia buffs in the U.S. Soccer Communications Department would be hard pressed to tell you that one Jack Marshall received his one and only cap way back in 1926. Okay, that was pretty much impossible. They get easier. We give you four questions each month, 1 to 4, easy to hard.\n\nAnswer #1 correctly, and it's safe to assume you haven't been stuck in a cave for the last five years.\nAnswer #2 correctly, and you already know more about soccer than any anchor from \"SportsCenter\".\nAnswer #3 correctly, you're probably pretty proud of yourself. Don't be. Try Question #4.\nIf you answered #4 correctly, you are either N.Y. Daily News soccer writer Michael Lewis or you own a U.S. Soccer Media Guide.\n\nThis month's trivia has to do with the annual, upset-friendly, \"knock-out\" tournament known as the Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup.\n\nQuestions:\nQ1: (Difficulty level 1 of 4) True or False: The U.S. Open Cup is the oldest soccer competition in the United States.\nQ2: (2 of 4) Who was the first MLS team to win the U.S. Open Cup?\nQ3: (3 of 4) Who are the two United Soccer Leagues to team to win the U.S. Open Cup in the 90's, and what year did each team take the crown?\nQ4: (4 of 4) What year did the Open Cup competition not have an outright winner?\n\nFor answers see: http://www.ussoccer.com/news/fullstory.sps?iNewsid=2471\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTo end your membership in ussoccerfan.com, please visit http://membership.ussoccer.com/member/unsubscribe.sps?msmid=1 and fill out an unsubscribe request.

The effect of President Bush's recently  proposed economic stimulus package is difficult to gauge given that consumer and  corporate spending remain so unpredictable. Experts agree, however, that the  timing of the stimulus will have a major impact on its success or  failure.http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/whatshot.cfm \nFinance and Investment\nJapan's Economic Outlook Remains Gloomy But Opportunities Exist  for Investors\nJapan's stock market - and its economy - have  been in a dismal state since the beginning of the 1990s. The Sept. 11 terrorist  attacks in New York and Washington made matters worse, pushing the country into  what analysts say is Japan's fourth recession in a decade. But Wharton faculty  and outside market analysts add that some sectors of the Japanese economy should  be attractive for long-term investors.http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/articles.cfm?catid=1&articleid=445 \nStrategic Management\nWhat Webvan Could Have Learned from  Tesco\nWebvan, the ambitious online grocer, once bragged that  it would set a new standard for Internet retailing. As most people now know, for  all its hubris the company has turned out to be one of the dot-com economy's  most spectacular failures. After burning its way through $1.2 billion in  capital, it declared bankruptcy in July. But does Webvan's collapse mean that  shoppers dislike buying groceries online? For a part of the answer, look across  the Atlantic to a Britain-based supermarket chain called Tesco. Its online arm,  Tesco.com, will probably have revenues of $420 million this year.http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/articles.cfm?catid=7&articleid=448 \nFinance and Investment\nIs Behavioral Finance a Growth Industry?\nCan  psychology really help us understand financial markets? Yes, say many academics.  The subdiscipline of behavioral finance - which argues that investors are not as  rational as traditional theory assumes and that their biases can affect asset  prices - has gained ground over the past five years. Although behavioral finance  attracts powerful criticism - and at times is clearly been oversold -- it seems  to be growing up. Experts at Wharton and other business schools provide some  perspectives.http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/articles.cfm?catid=1&articleid=444 \nHealth Economics\nPrescription Drug Coverage for Seniors Faces Uncertain  Future\nLess than a year ago, in the heat of the presidential  campaign, it seemed almost certain that Medicare would undergo a major  transformation that would provide prescription drug coverage to the program's 40  million seniors. But that was before an economic slowdown and the Sept. 11  terrorist attacks. Now there are new, more urgent priorities and it's unclear  just when the debate over drug coverage will again get underway.http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/articles.cfm?catid=6&articleid=442 \nPublic Policy and Management\nAre  Government Bailouts Bad Business?\nEven the most cold-hearted  free-marketer would concede the airlines got a tough break in the two-day  grounding after the terrorist attacks. No manager could have been expected to  anticipate events on the scale of Sept. 11, or to set aside enough money to  cover the revenue shortfalls that followed. So a government bailout is a  reasonable response, right? Not necessarily, say those who have studied past  examples of government bailouts.http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/articles.cfm?catid=9&articleid=446 \nFinance and Investment\nThe Man Who  Made Wall Street Finally Gets Credit\nWhen a book is entitled  The Man Who Made Wall Street, you just don''t expect the sub-title to read:  Anthony J. Drexel and the Rise of Modern Finance. Yet according to author Dan  Rottenberg, the much more famous J. Pierpont Morgan never made a move without  consulting Drexel, a Philadelphia banker who was as publicity-shy as he was  shrewd. The way Rottenberg sees it, there''s no limit to how much you can  accomplish, if you don''t care who gets the credit.http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/articles.cfm?catid=1&articleid=441 \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLinks  from Knowledge@Wharton Sponsors\nGE Capital:\nSales-Leasebacks: Benefits and Challenges\nToday  CFOs must negotiate their way through a weakened economy. But even as they  search for new ways to generate revenue and conserve capital, CFOs from a  variety of industries are discovering the value of one strategy --  sale-leasebacks -- that for many years was primarily focused on real estate  transactions. Sale-leasebacks are generally structured to unlock the equity a  business has in its assets (like machinery and equipment), converting that  equity into cash.http://www.gecfo.com/resources/wharton.html?n=Wharton&c=September&t=email \nGE Capital:\nMaximizing Your Trucking Fleet in Tough  Times\nTough times have hit the trucking industry as shippers  evaluate the best way to move goods around the country: Lease or buy?

Now shareholders could be on the hook for =\na $65 billion tab.\nJanice Revell\n\n11/26/2001\nFortune Magazine\nTime Inc.\n131\n(Copyright 2001)\n\nIt was an irresistible proposition: Borrow billions of dollars, pay no inte=\nrest, reap millions in tax breaks, and then wait for the debt to simply dis=\nappear. That was the promise of zero-coupon convertible bonds, and companie=\ns from Enron to Merrill Lynch binged on what seemed like free money.=20\nBut, of course, there was a catch: For this scenario to play out, a company=\n's stock price had to rise sharply--and quickly. That's because investors b=\nought the bonds in the hope of converting them into equity--if the stock ta=\nnked, the bonds would no longer be worth converting. So to make them more a=\nttractive to buyers, companies had to build in an escape hatch: If the stoc=\nk price failed to rise sufficiently, investors could \"put\" (that is, sell) =\nthe bonds back to the company--in many cases, after just one year.\nAnd that's exactly what's about to happen--to the tune of some $65 billion =\nover the next three years. Stock prices have fallen so far that for at leas=\nt half of these special hybrids, the prospect of conversion is now absurd. =\nIt simply won't happen. So bondholders are looking to get their money back =\nthe first chance they can. And because of the put feature, that is possible=\n. Suddenly companies like Tyco, Comcast, and dozens more are on the hook fo=\nr billions of dollars in debt and interest they thought they'd never have t=\no pay.=20\nThat could be very bad news for shareholders of these companies. After all,=\n they're the ones who are going to be picking up the tab when all that debt=\n comes due. Huge chunks of cash will disappear from balance sheets to repay=\n bondholders. Companies without enough cash-- and the majority fall into th=\nis camp--are likely to face skyrocketing interest charges when they borrow =\nmoney anew. That means sharply reduced earnings. Especially at risk are inv=\nestors in companies with poor credit ratings--prime candidates for killer r=\nefinancing costs. Some companies may even be forced to issue stock to pay o=\nff the debt, creating significant shareholder dilution, especially at curre=\nnt depressed prices. To make matters worse, this is happening at a time whe=\nn the economy is barreling downhill and corporate profits are already shrin=\nking. \"This is a ticking time bomb,\" warns Margaret Patel, manager of the P=\nioneer High Yield Bond fund, a top-performing junk fund.=20\nThe seeds of this mess were sown in mid-2000, when the stock market started=\n to falter. Companies in search of capital balked at the thought of selling=\n stock while their share prices were struggling. Zero-coupon convertible bo=\nnds presented an attractive alternative because companies didn't have to ma=\nke cash interest payments on the bonds (hence the name \"zero\"). Instead iss=\nuers offered an up-front discount--for instance, investors would buy a bond=\n for $700 and collect $1,000 when it matured.=20\nCompanies also gave investors the right to convert the bonds into a fixed n=\number of common shares. But the bonds were structured so that conversion wo=\nuld make sense only if the stock price rose significantly--in many cases, b=\ny more than 50%. With that protective feature (called the conversion premiu=\nm), zeros took off. Corporate issuers would pay no interest, and once their=\n stock prices had climbed back to acceptable levels, the debt would be swep=\nt away into equity. \"If the bonds are converted, it's a home run for everyb=\nody,\" says Jonathan Cohen, vice president of convertible-bond analysis at D=\neutsche Bank.=20\nThat four-bagger, of course, depends entirely on the stock price rising. If=\n it doesn't, the bondholders, armed with that handy put feature, can simply=\n sell the bonds back to the company. Great for bondholders, but not so hot =\nfor the company or its shareholders. But, hey, what are the odds of that ha=\nppening? \"CFOs and CEOs believe that their stock will just continue to go u=\np,\" says Cohen. \"They don't worry about the bond getting put.\"=20\nIf all this seems a little complicated, that's because it is. A real-life e=\nxample should help. California-based electric utility Calpine issued $1 bil=\nlion in zeros in April to refinance existing debt. At the time, the company=\n's stock was trading at about $55 a share--severely undervalued in the opin=\nion of company management. \"We really didn't want to sell equity at that po=\nint,\" says Bob Kelly, Calpine's senior vice president of finance. So the co=\nmpany instead opted to sell zeros, setting the conversion premium at a heft=\ny 37%.=20\nStill, with no cash interest payments and a stock price that had to rise si=\ngnificantly to make conversion worthwhile, the bonds weren't exactly a scre=\naming buy for investors. So Calpine added the put feature: Investors could =\nsell the bonds back to the company after one year at the full purchase pric=\ne, eliminating any downside risk.=20\nThings haven't exactly worked out as management had hoped. The stock has si=\nnce plummeted to $25, and it now has to triple before conversion makes sens=\ne. So it's looking as though Calpine will be liable for the $1 billion in b=\norrowed money when investors get the chance to put the bonds this April. Th=\nere's also the refinancing cost. According to Kelly, Calpine's borrowing ra=\nte could run in the neighborhood of 8.5%--an extra $85 million per year in =\ncash. \"Obviously, nobody plans for their stock to go down,\" Kelly says. \"I =\ndon't think there was one person around who thought the bond would be put.\"=\n=20\nCalpine's potential costs are particularly high because its credit rating i=\ns straddling junk. \"If you are a borderline investment-grade company, a fin=\nancing of this nature is not necessarily the most appropriate thing in the =\nworld,\" notes Anand Iyer, head of global convertible research at Morgan Sta=\nnley. The problem is, there are a slew of companies with far worse credit r=\natings out there: Jeff Seidel, Credit Suisse First Boston's head of convert=\nible-bond research, estimates that about half of all zeros outstanding fall=\n into the junk category. And others are at risk of having their ratings dow=\nngraded before the put date. Today, with junk yielding as much as 5 1/2 per=\ncentage points above bonds rated investment grade, refinancing can be a pri=\ncey proposition.=20\nContract manufacturer Solectron is one that could well get hit by the high =\nprice of junk. It has $845 million in zeros that it will probably have to b=\nuy back this January, and another $4.2 billion coming down the pike over th=\ne next couple of years. Because of slower- than-expected sales, the company=\n was recently put on negative credit watch by three rating agencies. And if=\n Solectron's credit is downgraded, the zeros would slide into junk status, =\na situation that could cost the company--and its shareholders--tens of mill=\nions of dollars in refinancing charges.=20\nRefinancing isn't the only worrisome cost associated with these zeros. Comp=\nanies pay hefty investment banking fees to sell their bonds--up to 3% of th=\ne amount raised. If the debt is sold back, many will have spent millions fo=\nr what essentially amounted to a one-year loan. \"They're getting bad advice=\n,\" claims one banker who didn't want to be named. \"Look at the fee the bank=\ner earned and look at the kind of financing risk the company got into.\"=20\nAs if those potential consequences were not scary enough, shareholders can =\nalso get whacked when the bonds are first issued. That's because some 40% a=\nre bought by hedge funds, which short the company's stock (sell borrowed sh=\nares with the intention of buying them back at a lower price) at the same t=\nime that they buy the bonds. If the stock goes down, the shorts make money =\nfrom their position. If it goes up, they profit by converting the bond to s=\ntock. This hedging strategy almost always causes the stock to plummet, at l=\neast for a while. Grocery chain Supervalu, for example, recently lost 10% o=\nf its market cap the day it announced it was issuing $185 million in zeros.=\n=20\nDespite all the pitfalls, the love affair with such Pollyanna bonds continu=\nes, thanks in large part to the slick tax and accounting loopholes they pro=\nvide. In fact, the hit on earnings per share can be the lowest of any form =\nof financing. Even better, thanks to a wrinkle in the tax code, companies c=\nan rake in huge tax savings by deducting far more interest than they're act=\nually paying. All they have to do is agree to pay small amounts of interest=\n if certain conditions prevail. Verizon Communications, for instance, would=\n pay 0.25% annual interest on its $3 billion in zero bonds if its stock pri=\nce falls below 60% of the issue's conversion price. In the eyes of the IRS,=\n oddly, that clause enables the company to take a yearly interest deduction=\n, for tax purposes, of 7.5%--the same rate it pays on its regular debt. (Wh=\ny? Trust us, you don't want to know.) That adds up to an annual deduction o=\nf more than $200 million, even if Verizon never shells out a dime in intere=\nst. Not surprisingly, more than half of the zeros issued in 2001 contain si=\nmilar clauses. \"It's an incredible deal for them,\" says Vadim Iosilevich, w=\nho runs a hedge fund at Alexandra Investment Management. \"Not only are they=\n raising cheap money, they're also doing tax arbitrage.\"=20\nSo despite the enormous risks to shareholders, companies continue to issue =\nzeros at a steady clip: According to ConvertBond.com, seven new issues, tot=\naling $3.5 billion, have been sold since Oct. 1 alone. \"I think the power o=\nf the tax advantage is going to keep them around,\" says CSFB's Seidel. Call=\n it greed or just blind optimism that the markets will recover quickly--it =\ndoesn't really matter. Either way, it's the shareholders who'll be left pay=\ning the bill.=20\nFEEDBACK: jrevell@fortunemail.com=20\nThe bill comes due=20\nCompanies issued convertible zeros, with put features, when the stock marke=\nt soured.

Subject to the vagaries of=\n age (Jack Welch), product failure (Ford/Firestone tires), competition (Luc=\nent, AT&T), technology (Hewlett-Packard and Compaq), and dot-bomb bubbles (=\nCMGI), managers and their firms remind us that being an icon is risky busin=\ness. The latest example is Enron, whose fall from grace has resulted in a p=\nroposed fire sale to Dynegy.=20\nOnce considered one of the country's most innovative companies, Enron becam=\ne a pariah due to lack of transparency about its deals and the odor of conf=\nlicts of interest. The journalistic accounts of Enron's struggles drip with=\n schadenfreude, hinting that its innovations and achievements were all a mi=\nrage.\nWe hold no brief regarding the legal or ethical issues under investigation.=\n We agree that more transparency about potential conflicts of interest is n=\needed. High profitability does not justify breaking the law or ethical norm=\ns. But no matter how the current issues resolve themselves or what fresh re=\nvelations emerge, Enron has created an enormous legacy of good ideas that h=\nave enduring value.=20\n-- Deregulation and market competition. Enron envisioned gas and electric p=\nower industries in the U.S. where prices are set in an open market of biddi=\nng by customers, and where suppliers can freely choose to enter or exit. En=\nron was the leader in pioneering this business.=20\nMarket competition in energy is now the dominant model in the U.S., and is =\nspreading to Europe, Latin America, and Asia. The winners have been consume=\nrs, who have paid lower prices, and investors, who have seen competition fo=\nrce the power suppliers to become much more efficient. The contrary experie=\nnce of California, the poster child of those who would re-regulate the powe=\nr industry, is an example of not enough deregulation.=20\n-- Innovation and the \"de-integration\" of power contracts. Under the old re=\ngulated model of delivering gas and electricity, customers were offered a o=\nne-size-fits-all contract. For many customers, this system was inflexible a=\nnd inefficient, like telling a small gardener that you can only buy manure =\nby the truckload. Enron pioneered contracts that could be tailored to the e=\nxact needs of the customer.=20\nTo do this, Enron unbundled the classic power contract into its constituent=\n parts, starting with price and volume, location, time, etc., and offered c=\nustomers choices on each one. Again, consumers won. Enron's investors did t=\noo, because Enron earned the surplus typically reaped by inventors. Arguabl=\ny, Enron is the embodiment of what economist Joseph Schumpeter called the \"=\nprocess of Creative Destruction.\" But creative destroyers are not necessari=\nly likable, pleasant folks, which may be part of Enron's problem today.=20\n-- Minimization of transaction costs and frictions. Enron extended the logi=\nc of de-integration to other industries. An integrated paper company, for i=\nnstance, owns forests, mills, pulp factories, and paper plants in what amou=\nnts to a very big bet that the paper company can run all those disparate ac=\ntivities better than smaller, specialized firms. Enron argued that integrat=\ned firms and industries are riddled with inefficiencies stemming from burea=\nucracy and the captive nature of \"customers\" and \"suppliers.\" Enron envisio=\nned creating free markets for components within the integrated chain on the=\n bet that the free-market terms would be better than those of the internal =\noperations. The development of free-market benchmarks for the terms by whic=\nh divisions of integrated firms do business with each other is very healthy=\n for the economy.=20\n-- Exploiting the optionality in networks. In the old regulated environment=\n, natural gas would be supplied to a customer through a single dedicated pi=\npeline. Enron envisioned a network by which gas could be supplied from a nu=\nmber of possible sources, opening the customer to the benefits of competiti=\non, and the supplier to the flexibility of alternative sourcing strategies.=\n Enron benefited from controlling switches on the network, so that they cou=\nld nimbly route the molecules or electrons from the best source at any mome=\nnt in time to the best use, and choose when and where to convert molecules =\nto electrons. This policy, picked up by others in the industry, created tre=\nmendous value for both customers and suppliers.=20\n-- Rigorous risk assessment. The strategy of tailored contracts could easil=\ny have broken the firm in the absence of a clear understanding of the tradi=\nng risks that the firm assumed, and of very strong internal controls. Enron=\n pioneered risk assessment and control systems that we judge to be among th=\ne best anywhere. Particularly with the advent of Enron Online, where Enron =\nmade new positions valued at over $4 billion each day, it became essential =\nto have up-to-the-second information on company-wide positions, prices and =\nability to deliver.=20\nThe unexpected bad news from Enron has little to do with trading losses by =\nthe firm, but with fears among trading partners about Enron's ability to fi=\nnance its trading activity. In a world where contracts and trading portfoli=\nos are too complex to explain in a sound bite, counterparties look to a thi=\nck equity base for assurance. It was the erosion in equity, rather than tra=\nding risk, that destroyed the firm.=20\n-- A culture of urgency, innovation and high expectations. Enron's corporat=\ne culture was the biggest surprise of all. The Hollywood stereotype of a ut=\nility company is bureaucratic, hierarchical, formal, slow, and full of excu=\nses. And the stodgy images of a gas pipeline company -- Enron only 15 years=\n ago -- is even duller and slower. Enron became bumptious, impatient, lean,=\n fast, innovative, and demanding. It bred speed and innovation by giving it=\ns professionals unusual freedom to start new businesses, create markets, an=\nd transfer within the firm.=20\nSuccess was rewarded with ample compensation and fast promotion, and an ope=\nn-office design fostered brainstorming. The firm's organization and culture=\n was by all accounts not a safe haven for those who believe the role of a l=\narge corporation is to fulfill entitlements for jobs. This was a lightning =\nrod for the firm's detractors. And yet, it could serve as a model for more =\nhide-bound enterprises to emulate.=20\nEnron was a prolific source of compelling new ideas about the transformatio=\nn of American business. It created a ruckus in once-quiet corners of the bu=\nsiness economy. It rewrote the rules of competition in almost every area in=\n which it did business. It thrived on volatility.=20\nThe proposed sale of Enron to Dynegy risks the loss of a major R&D establis=\nhment, especially given Dynegy's track record as a second mover following E=\nnron's lead. Beyond what is likely to be a difficult and time-consuming ant=\nitrust review, Dynegy's greater challenge will be to find a way to make Enr=\non's spirit of innovation its own. Or so we all should hope, because prospe=\nrity depends on the ability of firms to reinvent themselves and remake thei=\nr industries.=20\n---=20\nMessrs.

Morgan Wins (by Not Losing as Much)\nBy Susanne Craig\nStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal\n\n11/19/2001\nThe Wall Street Journal\nC1\n(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)\n\nYou know things are bad on Wall Street when the winner of a stock-selection=\n contest can't come close to breaking even.=20\nJ.P. Morgan Chase & Co.'s portfolio was the only one in The Wall Street Jou=\nrnal's quarterly stock-picking survey to slide less than 10% during the thr=\nee months ended Sept. 30. The value of its stock basket fell 8.6% during th=\ne third quarter.\nJust six of the 15 financial firms managed to beat the benchmark Standard &=\n Poor's 500-stock index, which dropped 14.7% during the period. Among the s=\ntar performers that came to J.P. Morgan's rescue: Northrop Grumman Corp., S=\nBC Communications Inc. and Procter & Gamble Co.=20\n\"It has turned into a real stock-picker's market,\" says J.P. Morgan equity =\nstrategist Douglas Cliggott. \"In the first half, the market bought cyclical=\n stocks, such as credit cards and brokers, in hopes of a recovery. We don't=\n think those stocks will get interesting until sometime in 2003.\" Instead, =\nthe firm's portfolio is weighted toward health care and consumer staples, a=\ns well as cyclical stocks such as energy and farm equipment.=20\nThe quarter was among the roughest in years for Wall Street investors. The =\nterrorist attacks of Sept. 11 helped contribute to the stock-market losses,=\n which drove down the value of all portfolios in the survey, though the mar=\nkets have since recovered to their pre-Sept. 11 levels. The last time the g=\nroup posted results this bad was during the third quarter of 1998, during t=\nhe Asian financial crisis.=20\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc. and Credit Suisse Group's Credit Suisse First Bost=\non finished at the bottom of the pack, falling 23.2% and 30.1% respectively=\n. The performance of last-place finisher CSFB was dragged down by losses at=\n companies such as Veritas Software Corp. (down 72.3% in the quarter), Prae=\ncis Pharmaceuticals Inc. (down 64.8%) and software provider Amdocs Ltd. (do=\nwn 51%).=20\nFor CSFB, \"it was not a good stock-picking quarter, that's for sure,\" says =\nAl Jackson, the firm's global head of equity research. \"It was our tech and=\n telecom . . . and the events of Sept. 11 that hurt us.\"=20\nCredit Suisse First Boston recently changed the approach to its model portf=\nolio, opting against sector weightings, Mr. Jackson says. This strategy has=\n hurt CSFB in recent quarters, because of the steep slump in areas such as =\ntechnology and telecom. The firm recently added a number of Old Economy sto=\ncks to its portfolio, such as Citigroup Inc., Dow Chemical Co. and Gannett =\nCo. Says Mr. Jackson: \"We are going back to our roots and asking what our b=\nest ideas are.\"=20\nLike CSFB, Goldman was hit by a drop in the share price of technology compa=\nnies, such as Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. (down 56.5% in the qua=\nrter). Its portfolio was also dragged down by shares of embattled Enron Cor=\np. (down 44.3%). Morgan Stanley and Royal Bank of Canada's RBC Dain Rausche=\nr, which placed 6th and 12th respectively, also have the energy company on =\ntheir lists.=20\nIn addition to Enron, stocks hard it by the terrorist attacks, such as lodg=\ning giant Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc., Walt Disney Co. and air=\nlines such as Skywest Inc., also hurt the portfolio performance of many sec=\nurities firms.=20\nIt is unlikely people will buy any company's entire recommended list at one=\n time. The Journal survey is intended to give investors an idea of how thei=\nr portfolio would look if they let the professionals do all the picking. Ca=\nlculations in the quarterly survey, done for the Journal by Zacks Investmen=\nt Research in Chicago, take into account capital gains or losses, dividends=\n and theoretical commissions of 1% on each trade.=20\nOverall, Edward D. Jones & Co., of St. Louis, emerged with the most consist=\nent results across the board, placing second in the quarter and for the yea=\nr. Its 85% return over five years is the best of the group and ahead of the=\n total return for the S&P 500 of 62.7%. Perhaps more than any other firm, E=\ndwards Jones takes a buy-and-hold approach to investing, making very few ch=\nanges to its portfolio from quarter to quarter, or even year to year.=20\n\"It's the old story of the tortoise and the hare, and we believe slow and s=\nteady wins the race,\" says David Otto, Edward Jones director of research. \"=\nWe are really, really proud of the five-year number. We believe in getting =\nrich, slowly.\"=20\nOn a quarterly basis, the portfolio of Prudential Securities Inc., a unit o=\nf Prudential Financial, came in second only to J.P. Morgan, falling 11.8%. =\nHowever, investors sitting with the stocks Prudential recommends haven't do=\nne as well in the long run. The value of its basket of stocks has fallen 45=\n.9% in the past year, finishing ahead of only Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.=\n, which posted a one-year loss of 54.9%.=20\nSeven firms managed to beat the S&P 500 index during the past 12 months, wh=\nich fell 26.6% in the period.=20\nLehman, which finished last in the survey in the second quarter thanks to i=\nts heavy weighting in technology, managed to move up in the rankings this q=\nuarter. This primarily stemmed from its annual shuffle of the 10 stocks in =\nits portfolio, known as its \"Ten Uncommon Values.\" This time around, the fi=\nrm's portfolio slipped 18.4% in the quarter, for an 11th place finish. Just=\n one of its 10 stocks, Washington Mutual Inc., managed to eke out a positiv=\ne return, of 3.1%. Its biggest quarterly loser: Energy company Mirant Corp.=\n, which fell 36.3% in the period.=20\n\"It's a portfolio that has done decently since the market troughed,\" says J=\neff Applegate, Lehman's chief market strategist. He says he believes the ma=\nrket hit bottom Sept. 21.=20\n--- Brokerage Houses' Stock-Picking Prowess\n\nEstimated performance of stocks on the recommended lists of 15 major\nbrokerage houses through Sept. 30.

That crisis led to Enron's decision e=\narlier this month to be acquired by Dynegy Inc., a much smaller rival.\nThe German Bank, Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale of Dusseldorf, or Wes=\ntLB, is among several suitors for Wessex Water, people close to the discuss=\nions said. The sale has also attracted the attention of industry rivals lik=\ne Thames Water, owned by RWE of Germany. But such a combination would most =\nlikely incur a long review by regulators, who might either block the merger=\n on antitrust grounds, or exact stiff concessions, industry experts said.=\n=20\nWessex Water is likely to be sold for more than $:1 billion ($1.4 billion) =\nbut less than the $:1.4 billion that Enron paid for it in 1998, analysts sa=\nid.=20\n''In hindsight, we made some very bad investments in noncore businesses,'' =\nKenneth L. Lay, Enron's chairman and chief executive, told analysts in a co=\nnference call last week.

Wes=\ntLB executives declined to comment.=20\nWestLB has been aggressively pursuing acquisitions in Britain, bidding for =\nBritish Telecommunications' phone network and the nation's railway tracks c=\nontrolled by the troubled Railtrack, which is restructuring under governmen=\nt supervision.

Here was new money, meaning new spending on p=\nlants, equipment and jobs that could help pull the economy out of its slump=\n.=20\nThat $10.9 billion AT&T deal, and a slew of similar bond deals from big com=\npanies ranging from Boeing and Anheuser-Busch to Kraft Foods and General Mo=\ntors, may not provide as big of a boost as economists are banking on. That =\nis because corporations, like homeowners, are in the midst of a refinancing=\n boom.\nCorporations are hitting the market not just because rates are cheap, but b=\necause they often can't get money in other crucial markets. In particular, =\nthey are sidestepping the commercial paper market -- short-term corporate I=\nOUs used to finance day-to-day operations, where rates traditionally are lo=\nwest -- because investors are unwilling to finance many well-known corporat=\nions.=20\nThe result has been a huge jump in bond sales, the majority of which are us=\ned to reduce existing debt. Since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, about $13=\n5 billion in investment-grade bonds have been sold, up from about $78 billi=\non in the year-earlier period. Overall issuance this year is likely to set =\na record, clearing $600 billion, compared with $411 billion in 2000.=20\n\"The driving force behind this surge in bond issuance is refinancing short-=\nterm commercial paper to long-term debt,\" says John Lonski, chief economist=\n at Moody's Investors Service, a credit-rating agency.=20\nUsually, rising bond issuance presages economic growth. In 1991, corporatio=\nns sold a record number of bonds to exploit falling interest rates. But the=\nn, companies poured much of the money they raised back into their operation=\ns, a flurry of investment that foreshadowed the economic boom of the late 1=\n990s.=20\nThis time around, the surge in bond deals won't pump in enough new money to=\n the economy to make a dramatic difference. Though, as in the case of the m=\nillions of homeowners who are refinancing their mortgages to lower monthly =\npayments, it could help ease some pressure on stretched corporate-balance s=\nheets and help to fund some of the companies' day-to-day operations.=20\nNot all of the money being raised is to refinance short-term debt, of cours=\ne, and the string of bond deals shows that many of the nation's biggest bor=\nrowers have ready access to funding if they need it.=20\nBut most companies are similar to AT&T, which last week provided the bigges=\nt refinancing example yet.=20\nOver the next three months, the telecom company was facing $6.5 billion in =\nexpiring commercial paper. Under normal conditions, corporations pay off ma=\nturing commercial paper by \"rolling over\" that debt, or issuing new commerc=\nial paper to replace the old. But rolling over commercial paper became much=\n harder for AT&T after Moody's cut the company's short-term and long-term c=\nredit ratings. Through the bond deal, AT&T raised money at relatively attra=\nctive rates while avoiding the difficulties of the commercial-paper market.=\n=20\nOther companies facing downgrades also are scrambling to find alternatives =\nto the commercial-paper market through bonds, loans or revolving credit lin=\nes. \"The ripple effects of this are being felt throughout the capital marke=\nts,\" says Meredith Coffey, senior vice president at Loan Pricing Corp., a d=\nebt-market-analysis company.=20\nFor the most extreme cases, the bond markets don't offer refuge. Enron, ham=\nmered by a third-quarter loss of $618 million that led to a string of downg=\nrades, drew down $3.3 billion from its emergency bank credit line to repay =\ninvestors in its commercial paper. It then turned to its banks for an addit=\nional $1 billion loan to pay off more commercial-paper investors, thus tidi=\nng it over until it could merge with rival Dynegy.=20\nMost investment-grade companies aren't nearly so bad off, and thus have rea=\ndy access to bond investors. General Motors, for instance, had little troub=\nle selling $6 billion in debt last month, while Ford Motor easily sold bond=\ns totalling $9.4 billion.=20\nBut the surge in bond sales masks signs that even investment-grade companie=\ns are having trouble convincing investors that they are good for their mone=\ny.=20\nTake Ford. Standard & Poor's and Moody's downgraded Ford's debt ratings las=\nt month to triple-B-plus and single-A-3, respectively. With that rating, Fo=\nrd is far enough down the spectrum of investment-grade debt that many of th=\ne ultraconservative investors in commercial paper won't touch it, meaning t=\nhat it had to turn to corporate bonds to refinance its debt. Ford concedes =\nthat a big reason it is selling bonds was to avoid the trouble in the comme=\nrcial-paper market.=20\nBoyce Greer, the money-market group leader at Fidelity Investments, says he=\n often stops buying the commercial paper of a corporation at the first sign=\n of eroding profitability -- even before they get downgraded. \"You can't wa=\nit around for a rating agency [to downgrade a company],\" he says.=20\nMoody's has downgraded five times as many corporations as it has raised so =\nfar this year. Thus, the market for corporate commercial paper has shrunk t=\no $1.4 trillion at the end of October, down from $1.6 trillion at the end o=\nf last year.=20\n---=20\nFriday's Credit Markets=20\nLast week was a brutal time to own Treasurys. The market sold off so sharpl=\ny as to push yields, which move inversely to prices, almost back up to wher=\ne they stood before the terrorist attacks. It was the worst bond selloff si=\nnce 1987, according to economists at Banc One Capital Markets.=20\nLosses were heaviest in issues like the two-year note, the most sensitive t=\no expectations about Federal Reserve policy. Since hitting a record low of =\n2.30% on Nov. 7, the two-year yield has risen 0.80 percentage point to 3.05=\n%. In the same period, the 30-year bond yield has risen 0.50 percentage poi=\nnt to 5.27%.=20\nAt 4 p.m. Friday, the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was down 1 3/32 point=\ns from late Thursday, or $10.94 per $1,000 face value, at 100 25/32. Its yi=\neld jumped to 4.897% from 4.756% Thursday.=20\nThe 30-year Treasury bond's price fell 1 19/32 to 100 25/32 to yield 5.317,=\n up from 5.211% Thursday.=20\nWhy the selloff? People in the market cite a shift toward the view that the=\n U.S. economy may finally be on the brink of recovery. That means the Fed m=\nay not need to employ many more rate cuts to get growth back on track.=20\n-- Michael S. Derby and Steven Vames\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

By comparison, the Standard & P=\noor's 500-stock index has slumped nearly 14%.\nOf course, the risks in Russia remain. Despite recent economic gains, the c=\nountry still is struggling with a weak banking system, inadequate state ins=\ntitutions to enforce contract laws and few businesses run by the \"modern\" r=\nules of corporate governance, according to Samuel Oubadia the 37-year-old m=\nanager of the Russia fund.=20\n\"But they are getting more open,\" Mr. Oubadia said, though Russia's lax fin=\nancial reporting standards are still one of the main roadblocks for foreign=\n investors. With $49 million in assets, the Pilgrim Russia fund invests bet=\nween 90% and 95% in Russian stock, with the balance held in cash.=20\n\"While the global economy is slowing, Russia is still in an expansion mode,=\n\" Mr. Oubadia said. After years of economic reforms, consumer spending is u=\np 10% and the former Soviet Union's gross domestic product is expected to g=\nrow 3% to 5% next year, more than twice as much as that of the U.S. and Eur=\nope.=20\nTwo-thirds of the fund's stocks are oil and gas companies, which are still =\nthe most liquid stocks in Russia. Utilities, mining, telecommunications com=\npanies and breweries make up the rest. \"There's no escaping oil and gas if =\nyou want to manage a Russia fund,\" Mr. Oubadia said.=20\nThe spike in oil prices earlier this year made the investment in oil worthw=\nhile, propelling earnings growth for Russia's oil and gas companies. Higher=\n oil prices also worked wonders for the Russian economy, which is largely d=\nependent on oil and gas. More recently, however, falling oil prices have th=\nreatened the companies' profit growth.=20\nBut the fund manager, who is based in The Hague, said he doesn't think peop=\nle should invest in Russian oil stocks because of their earnings prospects.=\n \"You don't invest because of earnings growth -- there will be none for Rus=\nsian oil companies this year. You invest because of the stocks' low valuati=\non,\" Mr. Oubadia said, adding that most of the Russian oil companies still =\ntrade well below the world-wide average for the sector.=20\nYukos Oil is one of the fund's largest investments, making up about 12% of =\nthe fund's holdings. Surgutneftegaz and Lukoil Holdings also make up more t=\nhan 5% each of Pilgrim Russia's assets. While Mr. Oubadia said the companie=\ns should be able to handle falling oil prices, partly by cutting production=\n, he worries that further price erosion could hamper a fragile Russian stoc=\nk market that relies so heavily on oil and gas stocks.=20\n\"Can Russian markets do well with lower prices for oil?\" he asked. \"The sho=\nrt answer is yes. But how low will prices drop?\" Mr. Oubadia acknowledged t=\nhat weak oil prices might cause him to shift some investments from oil and =\ngas into other Russian sectors, including telecom stocks and consumer produ=\ncts.=20\nThe Russia fund isn't for the timid. In 1998, when the Russian economy coll=\napsed, the fund -- then called Lexington Troika Dialog Russia, lost 83% of =\nits value. A year later, the fund soared 160%. In 2000 the fund finished do=\nwn almost 18%.=20\n---=20\nJANUS STOCK SHUFFLE: Janus Capital Corp. bulked up on lower-priced value st=\nocks and shed some shares of its long-held technology companies during the =\nthird quarter, a new Securities and Exchange Commission filing showed.=20\nThe Denver fund firm reported that during the third quarter, it lowered its=\n investments in 14 of the 20 largest holdings it had owned as of June 30. T=\nhe largest reduction was a 43.6 million-share sale of Nokia Corp. stock. Af=\nter the sale, Janus still owned a large 183.2 million-share position in the=\n wireless-phone company at the end of the third quarter.=20\nDuring the quarter, Janus also sold more than half of its stakes in tech co=\nmpanies EMC Corp. and Sun Microsystems Inc. In addition, the fund company, =\na unit of Stilwell Financial Inc., trimmed its exposure to energy company E=\nnron Corp., selling 1.5 million shares to reduce its overall position to 41=\n.4 million shares at the end of September.=20\nOn the buying side, Janus, one of the hottest fund firms of the late 1990s =\nthanks to bets on leading technology stocks, about doubled its position in =\nsoftware company Microsoft Corp. It also boosted its holding in the investm=\nent company run by Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway Inc., while starting =\na small position in Philip Morris Cos., whose dividend-rich stock is usuall=\ny more popular with price-sensitive \"value\" managers. Janus has introduced =\nnew value portfolios recently, but most of its investors' assets still foll=\now faster-growing companies.=20\n-- Aaron Lucchetti and Todd Goren\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

All Rights Reserved.\n\nNEW YORK - Companies that trade with Enron Corp., the Houston, Texas-based =\nenergy group, are taking precautions in case Dynegy Inc., also of Houston, =\nwithdraws its $15.6-billion rescue bid for its rival, a decision that could=\n trigger a crisis in the energy trading market.=20\nCounter-parties to Enron, which is one of the principal market-makers provi=\nding liquidity in the energy market, are seeking to limit their exposure to=\n the group, in spite of reassurances from both Enron and Dynegy that the ta=\nkeover will go through.\nExperts also say the implications of the deal are so complex that the regul=\natory review could take much longer than the six to nine months company off=\nicials have estimated.=20\nAnalysts say the 27% spread between the value of Dynegy's offer price and E=\nnron's share price suggests a 65% to 75% chance the bid will succeed. But b=\nankers and energy executives are still worried about systemic risk, both in=\n the energy market and in financial markets, where companies such as Enron =\nuse derivatives to offset the risk of energy price fluctuations.=20\nEnron was close to meltdown until Dynegy stepped in with a rescue bid 10 da=\nys ago, having persuaded credit rating agencies not to downgrade Enron's de=\nbt to below investment grade.=20\nClauses built into the merger agreement signed with Enron give Dynegy the r=\night to walk away under certain circumstances, although the two companies' =\nofficials and advisors differ on how easy it would be for Dynegy to pull ou=\nt.=20\nWhile the situation remains uncertain, companies that deal with Enron are r=\neluctant to lock themselves into long-term contracts to buy or sell power, =\nsaid John Olson, an analyst at Sanders Morris Harris, the investment bankin=\ng arm of Houston, Texas-based Sanders Morris Harris Group.=20\nKeith Stamm, chief executive of Aquila Inc., the energy marketing and risk-=\nmanagement company, said his company had begun preparing contingency plans =\nin case the deal fell through.\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. =09\n\nBlackout in the power sector\nA V Rajwade\n\n11/19/2001\nBusiness Standard\n10\nCopyright (c) Business Standard\n\nEvery foreign company in the Indian power sector wants to exit. Of these, t=\nhe most controversial has been Enron and its Dabhol Power Company Ltd (DPCL=\n). This apart, the experience of investors in the \"reformed\" power sector i=\nn Orissa is also unhappy. Five years ago, Orissa was the first state to ado=\npt the World Bank-recommended model of separating generation, transmission =\nand distribution of power, and an independent regulator. The Godbole Commit=\ntee has recently recommended the same for Maharashtra as well.=20\nClearly, separating the three functions is a complex restructuring. Maybe i=\nt helps privatisation, the current fashion on the subject having been set i=\nn Thatcherite Britain. While some privatisations in UK have succeeded, the =\nexperience has not been consistent all over.\nTake UK's rail sector. While privatising, the government in its wisdom deci=\nded to separate the ownership of the rail network (Railtrack) and the owner=\nship and operation of trains. The contractual relationship between the vari=\nous operating companies and Railtrack were governed by a byzantine, bewilde=\nringly complex system of penalties and incentives, to be monitored by an in=\ndependent regulator.=20\nSuch separation had no parallel. Besides, Railtrack suffered from poor mana=\ngement, cost escalation in modernisation of tracks, etc. Several serious ac=\ncidents occurred and fixing responsibility became difficult. The \"reform\" d=\nid not work, and Railtrack was put back under public control last month.=20\nWhat are the chances of trifurcation of the power sector in India succeedin=\ng? Pretty poor, if the experience of Orissa is any guide. It faithfully sep=\narated the three functions, and privatised distribution and part of generat=\nion. AES, a foreign company, was 49 per cent investor in a generating compa=\nny, and 51 per cent in CESCO, a distribution company. As Gajendra Haldea an=\nalysed in this paper on August 27, \"The policy and regulatory framework was=\n inadequate and myopic.\"=20\nDistribution losses, a euphemism for power theft, were much larger than the=\n companies had been led to believe at the time of privatisation. CESCO defa=\nulted in paying the dues of GRIDCO, the transmission company, which in turn=\n defaulted to the generating company. Indeed, all CESCO's cash inflows are =\nnow escrowed, leaving it no money even to pay salaries. For all practical p=\nurposes, the distribution companies seem to be in a difficult situation, pe=\nrhaps beyond redemption, and the \"reform\" is a total mess.=20\nThe crux of the problem in the power sector is not whether a unified SEB is=\n less efficient than trifurcated companies it is the political unwillingnes=\ns to charge a price which covers the cost to all consumers. For a while, cr=\noss subsidisation worked with commercial consumers subsidising the househol=\nd and the agricultural segments.=20\nHowever, as the burden became too large, the commercial sector started movi=\nng to captive generation, further worsening SEB finances. An \"independent\" =\nregulator for power tariffs may not solve the problem. He may fix economic =\nprices but will the state come forward to protect the bill collectors, puni=\nsh power thiefs, face social unrest if power to recalcitrant consumers is c=\nut off? So long as the answers to these questions are in the negative, as, =\nsadly, they are, the institutional restructuring is no substitute for subst=\nantive action. No wonder all foreign investors in the power sector want to =\nget out!=20\nEnron too wants out but it has many more problems in its home country, over=\n and above its dispute with MSEB. It had attracted a lot of adverse publici=\nty for gouging power consumers in California, a state in a power crisis (se=\ne World Money, February 2, 2001). The Internet craze also had a hand in Enr=\non's misfortunes. It became an energy trader, established an electronic tra=\nding platform, had broadband ambitions, went into a disastrous diversificat=\nion in water supplies which, if I remember correctly, led to Rebecca Mark's=\n exit. Perhaps it went into too many areas too quickly under Jeffery Skilli=\nng, ex-McKinsey, and was notorious for opaque, complex accounts.=20\nTo top it all, last month it announced that it will take an extraordinary $=\n1.2 billion charge in its third quarter results for losses in financial act=\nivities. Enron's chief financial officer, who was supposed to be in charge =\nof these, has resigned amidst reports that a private equity fund associated=\n with him was involved in them. The SEC is investigating the affair and Enr=\non's share price is down 67 per cent since mid-October. There are some repo=\nrts that Shell may make a bid for Enron.=20\nAfter its ratings were downgraded, Enron is desperate for liquidity and anx=\nious to dispose its assets. DPCL was already on the platter; now a sale has=\n become even more urgent. Reportedly, Tatas and BSES are interested; so are=\n the lending institutions. Clearly, if a settlement is to be reached, this =\nis the optimum time.=20\nBut one is not very optimistic. For one, Delhi and Mumbai will be involved,=\n and bureaucracies never understand opportunity costs. Our byzantine decisi=\non-making processes make timely decisions impossible. Further, if a deal do=\nes take place, there will be the inevitable allegations of corruption. It i=\ns much safer for the reputation of the concerned ministers in Mumbai and De=\nlhi to allow the drift to continue, to \"let the law take its own course\", w=\nhatever the costs! Sadly, as Jairam Ramesh said in this paper, Indian polit=\nicians respond to developments only out of compulsion, not conviction.\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

(ENE), here's another piece of evidence - one that goes to the heart of the recent plunge in the company's stock.\nEnron doesn't simply trade for less than its book value; it fell below that milestone weeks ago. No, now it trades for less than ONE-THIRD of its book value. \nThat's a rare level for a company of Enron's size and prominence. And it may mean, among other things, that investors have decided that they simply can't place any further faith in the veracity of Enron's earnings and balance-sheet figures, much-revised as they've been - something that has unnerving implications for any attempt to value the company fairly. \nFirst, let's be clear about what this means. Enron stock is currently about $4 a share; the company's reported book value is about $12.90 a share. In other words, Enron stock sells for less than one-third of what shareholders would get if the company were to liquidate - were to turn all its assets into cash, pay off all its liabilities on its balance sheet and give what's left over to shareholders. \nThis is an uncommonly dismal level for any company, even a troubled one. For comparison's sake, Dynegy Inc. (DYN), which has agreed to buy Enron, trades at about three times book value, as does El Paso Corp. (EPG), a competitor of both companies. In fact, Enron has the second-lowest price-to-book ratio of any company in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index - only Conseco Inc. (CNC), another troubled company, is lower, by an eyelash. \nPart of the problem is undoubtedly the continuing fear among investors that Dynegy's agreement to buy Enron will fall apart, and the belief that Enron will have to file for bankruptcy if it does, in which case Enron shareholders would be hard-pressed to realize any value. The Dynegy deal now amounts to about $10.60 per Enron share, itself well under Enron's book value; the huge premium that level offers over Enron's current stock price is an indication of the big risk investors see that the deal won't be consummated in its current form. \nBut given Enron's current woes, it's certainly also possible that Enron is trading at such a big discount to book value because investors don't feel they can trust the earnings and balance-sheet numbers coming out of Enron. Those numbers, after all, are the raw material that form the basis for valuing Enron, or any other company, by computing figures like price-to-book and price-to-earnings ratios. \nAnd the Enron debacle has been all about the quality of those numbers, with Enron shifting assets off its balance sheet to outside limited partnerships from which some of its executives benefitted. In terms of those numbers, the ground has shifted underneath investors three separate times now - when the company slashed its reported shareholder equity by $1.2 billion to unwind its transactions with one of those partnerships, when it restated nearly five years' worth of earnings downward by a total of $586 million, and when it revealed that it could take further charges and was facing an imminent deadline to post collateral on a $690 million note. (That deadline has now been extended until Dec. 14.) \nWhen you've gotten punched in the face three times, it's not unreasonable to fear there'll be a fourth blow, no matter how much the puncher assures you there won't be. Given Enron's insanely complicated structure, and the way bad financial news has dribbled out of the company over the past several weeks, who can guarantee there aren't more such shocks yet to come? \nThat's what investors appear to be fearing, and that may be part of the reason Enron stock has fallen so precipitously. Thanks to Enron's repeated demonstrations that its numbers can't be relied on, investors no longer have a firm, trustworthy basis on which to value the stock. And so, not surprisingly, the value is getting ratcheted down to the most conservative, bare-minimum level. \nAn Enron spokesman couldn't be reached for comment. \nIt's ironic, in a way. For a long time, it was hard to properly value Enron because its structure and finances were so complex and hard to decipher. Now it's hard to properly value Enron because the company's attempts to clarify its finances have made it clear that it's hard to expect investors to trust in their accuracy. \n-By Michael Rapoport, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-5976; michael.rapoport@dowjones.com\n\n\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

(ENE), Dynegy's board isn't offering its opinion. \n\"Any comments coming out of Dynegy are coming from the company's executives,\" said Jerry Johnson, a Dynegy board member who also is an executive vice president at Safeguard Scientifics Inc. (SFE).\nJohnson declined to comment on any matters related the pending acquisition of its larger rival, and wouldn't say whether the board has been meeting to discuss the transaction. \nThree other board members, through their representatives, declined to comment as well. Other non-executive directors on the 14-member board either weren't immediately available to comment or couldn't be reached. \nAs for Dynegy's management, spokesman John Sousa said the company's opinion on the deal remains the same since its last comments on Wednesday. \nAt that time, Dynegy Chairman and Chief Executive Chuck Watson said Dynegy was continuing its due diligence and was looking to accelerate regulatory approval of the deal. \nAccording to Sousa, Dynegy worked through the holiday weekend gathering information as part of its due diligence efforts. \nMeanwhile, Enron continued its discussions to raise between $500 million to $1 billion of additional financing, said Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne. The company also is working to restructure its debt by mid-December, she said. \nBut investors appear to be voting with their feet. Enron shares were recently down 18.3%, or 86 cents, to $3.85, while Dynegy shares slipped 2.7%, or $1.06, to $39.34. As a result, the already huge discount to the deal's offer price has grown even bigger as the market continues to signal the deal won't get completed on its original terms. \nUnder the terms of the transaction, Enron shareholders are to receive 0.2685 of a Dynegy share for each share outstanding, or about $8.98 billion, based on Dynegy's recent stock price. \nAt Enron's recent level, the stock is trading at a 64% discount to the Dynegy offer. \nNeither Sousa or Denne would comment on the stock movement. \nDynegy has already provided Enron with a $1.5 billion cash infusion that is secured by Enron's pipeline assets. While that investment has helped Enron's near-term liquidity position, it remains unclear how long the company can remain solvent without any added investments. \n-By Christina Cheddar, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-5166; christina.cheddar@dowjones.com\n\n\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Remond and Christina Cheddar\n\n11/26/2001\nDow Jones News Service\n(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)\nOf Dow Jones Newswires \n\nNEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) and a group of banks last week formalized an agreement to extend the due date on a $690 million syndicated loan by three weeks to Dec. 14.\nThe loan relates to one of Enron's consolidated limited partnerships that owns minority interests in power and energy projects around the world. Enron said last week that Standard & Poor's downgrade of its credit rating to \"BBB-\" had triggered an obligation to repay the loan by Nov. 27. \nPeople familiar with the matter said last week that lead banks J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. and Enron will use the extension to negotiate a further postponement of the debt to the middle of 2002 when other Enron bank loans come due. About $1.75 billion of Enron's $3.5 billion in syndicated bank loans come due in May 2002 and will likely need to be restructured. \nAbout $250 million of the assets securing the $690 million loan are in the process of being sold and will be used to pay down the loan, reducing the outstanding portion of the loan that will need to be restructured, those people familiar with the matter said. \nEnron's shares and bonds continue to suffer from mounting uncertainties about the company's finances and whether those could force one-time rival Dynegy Inc. (DYN) to reconsider its offer to buy Enron, an offer that many see as Enron's only chance to avoid bankruptcy. Enron stock was recently down 18% to $3.84. Meanwhile, Enron bonds are also lower, with the 6.4% bonds due 2004 recently trading at a distressed level of 48 cents on the dollar. \nCarol S.

(C) is expected to extend a hand to Enron Corp. (ENE) by renegotiating a $690 million payment due Nov. 27. \nBut investors shouldn't be concerned that the financial services giant is too exposed to the embattled energy trading company. Citigroup already may have laid off the loan and other exposure via a series of credit default swap transactions. That means more institutional investors left holding the bag if Enron isn't ultimately rescued from financial collapse by a takeover proposed by Dynegy Inc. (DYN).\nOver the last few years, Citigroup has entered into at least six transactions that effectively would allow the bank to lay off the equivalent of $2.384 billion in Enron exposure. \nCitigroup was instrumental in setting up Enron Credit Linked Notes Trust, Enron Credit Linked Notes Trust II and Yosemite Securities Trust I, which together raised $1.750 billion; Enron Sterling Credit Linked Notes Trust and Yosemite Securities Co., which raised a combined GBP325 million; and Enron Euro Credit Linked Notes Trust, which issued EUR200 million. \nCitigroup, which acts as the default swap counterparty to the trusts, receives the return on the portfolio of single-A-plus-or-better-rated securities, purchased with the proceeds of the offerings, in exchange for providing the payout on the Enron exposure, according to Mary Ryan, director of synthetic securities ratings at Standard & Poor's. \nAs long as Enron remains out of bankruptcy, Citigroup continues to make payments on the notes, Ryan said. \nIf Enron defaults, Citigroup would cease making payments to the trust. The single-A-plus-or-higher-rated securities in the trusts would go to Citigroup in exchange for the same nominal amount of now in-default Enron debt obligations. And with speculation mounting that Dynegy will reduce, or maybe even scrap, its offer to buy Enron, the chances of a such a default-driven transfer would appear to be rising. \nThese notes essentially are synthetic Enron debts, meaning they act like Enron bonds in many respects, but lack key components that make holders true creditors of Enron. \nFor instance, the holders of these notes, because they don't possess actual Enron obligations - and won't unless the company defaults - are not involved in negotiations to restructure or rollover debt. It has been reported that Enron is engaged in active negotiations over the terms of its debts with creditors. \nThe synthetic notes all carry a rating equivalent to Enron's rating of triple-B-minus from Standard & Poor's and Baa3 from Moody's Investors Service. \nThe rating on the securities has been downgraded in recent weeks to reflect the downgrades in Enron's ratings. \nCitigroup officials did not respond to requests for further details on the transactions. -By Christine Richard, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-2189; \nchristine.richard@dowjones.com\n\n\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

(ENE) was sued Monday in the latest of at least three purported employee class action suits the company faces over lost 401(k) retirement savings due to the recent collapse of the price of Enron stock. \nIn a press release Monday, Eli Gottesdiener, a Washington, D.C. attorney who filed the latest suit on behalf of employees, said it seeks $850 million in plan losses, in part because the company sold Enron stock to its employees knowing the price was artificially inflated.\nAn Enron spokeswoman declined to comment. \nUnlike two similar, recently filed suits against Enron, the latest also contends that Enron offered the stock without the required prospectus. \nIf proven, the sale without a prospectus \"give workers the automatic right to rescind their purchases and receive their money back with interest,\" Gottesdiener said in a statement. \nEnron \"locked down\" the retirement plan from Oct. 17 to Nov. 19, to make administrative changes, which prevented employees from selling Enron shares as the share price collapsed amid growing disclosures of financial problems. \nEarlier this month, Houston-based Dynegy Inc. (DYN) offered to buy its far larger competitor in an all-stock deal that values Enron shares at $10.85 a piece, or about $9.2 billion. \nEnron later disclosed that its future earnings would be substantially less than expected and shares fell sharply. \nEnron currently trades at $4.05 a share, down from their 52-week high of $84.88 a share in December 2000. \nThe first suit was filed Nov. 13 on behalf of plaintiffs by Campbell Harrison & Wright LLP in Houston. A second was filed last week by Seattle-based Hagens Berman LLP. \n-John Seward; Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-5400 \n\n(Corrected 04:34 PM)\n\n\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Dynegy was down 1.60 usd at 38.80, amid broad declines in energy shares as crude prices sank.\nThe DJIA was up 57.70 points at 9,892.86. The S&P 500 was up 6.24 points at 1,143.27. The Nasdaq composite was up 11.94 points at 1,886.99. \nDealers said that with Enron shares having slid well below the Dynegy offer price of 9.85 usd a share, the ChevronTexaco affiliate may well reconsider its offer, or walk away from the deal all together. \n\"People are making the bet that perhaps Dynegy may cancel the deal, and that's there a lot more risk in playing the arbitrage,\" said Jefferies & Co market strategist Art Hogan. \nThe deal with Dynegy contains a \"material adverse change\" clause, which could be invoked to call the deal off, he said. \nAs part of its due diligence, Dynegy is examining details of Enron's filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission last week, which reportedly contained information it had not received previously. \nEnron shares have plunged further since the filing, in which Enron revealed a number of new financial problems including a possible obligation to repay a 690 mln usd note due Nov 27. \nEnron subsequently received an extension on the repayment until mid-December. \nSince the beginning of the year, Enron shares have lost over 90 pct of their value after it was revealed that the company would post hefty third-quarter charges linked to risky investments by the firm's former chief financial officer. \n\"At this point, with so much smoke around the fire, I think the shares are rightly valued,\" said Jefferies' Hogan. \nng/gc\n\n\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Dynegy has agreed to pay $10.55 per share for Enron.\n\"The market is acting like the deal is not going through or not going through at the original terms,\" said Michael Heim, an industry analyst at A.G. Edwards & Sons. \nHeim said that among three possible scenarios - the deal goes through as planned, it is canceled, or it is restructured - the first is the least likely. \n\"Escape clauses\" built into the Dynegy-Enron deal give the buyer the option to back out if there is serious deterioration in Enron's business or assets. \n\"Dynegy has a good claim that the 'material adverse condition' clause has already been triggered, either by the $690 million loan being accelerated, earnings (being) down or the ongoing trading business weakness,\" he said. \nLast week Enron said it could be forced to pay a $690 million debt this week because of a credit downgrade, but the payment deadline has been delayed until mid-December. \nEnron's recent admission that lower volumes at its trading business - the crown jewel that Dynegy most covets - could cause low fourth-quarter earnings raises the possibility that the trading business is losing its profitability. Continued lower volumes there would remove a key attraction for Dynegy. \n\"Every day that goes by where Enron trading volumes become less, it decreases the value of the assets Dynegy was trying to buy in the first place,\" Heim said. \"Besides trading and marketing, what value does Enron have?\" \nThe majority of Enron's physical assets are spoken for, with partnerships and creditors getting first dibs and Dynegy getting the first right to exercise its option to acquire Enron's Northern Natural Gas pipeline. \nDynegy, which is 26.5 percent-owned by energy giant ChevronTexaco , is to swap 0.2685 share of its own stock for each share of Enron. Shares of Dynegy were down $1.27, or 3.1 percent, at $39.13 in midmorning NYSE trade. \nEnron agreed to a Dynegy buyout after it was overwhelmed by a series of problems, including a U.S. regulatory probe of off-balance-sheet dealings by its officers, a $1.2 billion cut in shareholder equity, and cuts in its credit ratings. \nEnron subsequently restated its earnings, but investor unease snowballed and its share began tumbling. The shares were above $90 in August 2000. \nHeim said he was not sure that EnronOnline, Enron's online trading platform, is the premier property it once was. \n\"Two years ago it had some value, but now others have been able to duplicate it. It's not the computer systems - it's the traders and network that Enron had. If those go away, the value lessens.\n\n\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

All three suits seek class-action status. \nEnron's shares have fallen from a high of $90 in August 2000 to less than $5 today, their decline accelerating since Oct 16 amid a series of disclosures about its deteriorating finances. \nLike many other companies, Enron makes matching contributions to its employees' 401 (k) retirement accounts in its own stock. It also requires them to hold the stock they receive in matching contributions until they turn 50. \nEnron employees were also prevented from selling Enron stock held in retirement accounts for several weeks from mid-October due to a change in the retirement plan's administrator. \nGottesdiener said investment advisors recommend investing no more than 15 percent of a portfolio in a single stock, but that participants in 401 (k) plans offering employer stock as a choice typically hold 33 percent of their portfolio in that stock. \n\"Congress sensibly placed a 10 percent limit on company stock in traditional defined benefit plans back in 1974, but at the behest of the corporate lobby, it placed no such cap on defined contribution plans,\" he said. \nThe absence of such a cap in defined-contribution 401 (k) plans was \"completely indefensible,\" he said. \nGottesdiener's suit alleges that Enron violated federal securities law by offering and selling Enron stock to employees without issuing a prospectus. If proven, this would give workers the right to reverse their purchases, he said. \nGottesdiener is also involved in class action pensions litigation against New York Life Insurance Co. and SBC Communications Inc..\n\n\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Though absolute returns for investment-grade corporate bonds \nare negative, they are even worse in the Treasury market, where \ninvestors appear more convinced that the current U.S. economic \ndownturn won't be deep or long. \n\"The successes in Afghanistan and some milder-than-anticipated \neconomic data have combined to increase investor appetite for \nrisk,\" wrote fixed-income research service CreditSights Inc. in a \nreport dated Monday. \"While the severity and swiftness of the bond \nmarket's correction was a surprise, it hasn't changed our basic \nview of U.S. corporate bonds and we continue to recommend \noverweight positions.\" \nThis week's forward calendar remains quiet. \nIn early trading, 10-year Treasuries rose 10/32, as their \nyields fell to 4.971 percent. \nENRON \nMarket participants are closely watching Houston-based Enron \nCorp. as the largest U.S. energy trader tries to merge \nwith smaller cross-town rival Dynegy Inc. , keep its \ninvestment-grade credit ratings, and manage a load of $9.15 \nbillion of debt and other obligations, much of which is unsecured \nand coming due within 13 months. \nOf this debt amount, $690 million could come due by \nmid-December, and $3.9 billion immediately if Enron falls to junk \nstatus. The key to resolution of this matter, some observers \nbelieve, is Enron's banks. \n\"The goal of the banks now is to re-cut their exposure to gain \nas much structural seniority or asset liens as possible, take out \nfees, raise rates, take down total exposure, and generally improve \ntheir risk-profile under multiple scenarios,\" said CreditSights. \n\"The very bankers who are supplying liquidity through new \nsecured bank lines and who are rumored to be considering equity \ninvestments are the ones on the hook (and unsecured) for $3 \nbillion in bank loans,\" wrote Carol Levenson, an analyst for \nGimmeCredit, another fixed-income research service. \"If Dynegy \nbacks out (in the interest of self-preservation), these vital bank \nrenegotiations might save Enron but leave unsecured bondholders as \nthe patsies.\" \nEnron's existing 6.4 percent notes maturing in 2006 and 6.75 \npercent notes maturing in 2009 were bid on Friday at 57 cents on \nthe dollar, down from around par on October 12, before Enron first \nreported third quarter results, which it later revised downward. \nEnron shares have fallen 94 percent this year to their lowest \nlevel since early 1989. \nDATA \nInvestment-grade and junk bond spreads narrowed 0.1 and 0.27 \npercentage point last week, respectively, to 1.68 and 7.84 \npercentage points, according to Merrill Lynch & Co.

That was followed by renewed volatility in power prices, and this time the prices were headed down, not up. \nAnd then came a crushing blow against trading firms - the unraveling of the industry's largest player, Enron Corp. (ENE). \nSimply put, the perfect storm stalled, and a business once buoyed by high gas prices, strong demand and tight supply now lies in tatters. \nThe stocks of companies whom some say should be valued more like growth stocks than utilities are instead mired at around nine-times earnings - about where traditional utilities trade. \nAnd the chance for recovery in 2002? \nBasu Mullick, portfolio manager of the Neuberger Berman Partners fund, is willing to bet there is. He thinks energy traders deserve at least the same price-to-earnings multiple as the broader market's median, which is currently between 16- to 17-times future earnings, he said. It's just a matter of time before the stocks get there. \n\"They were just recovering from Gray Davis,\" Mullick said, referring to the governor of California, who had accused \"out-of-state\" energy traders of artificially inflating the price of power in the state, and triggering the state's energy crisis. \"Now, they are recovering from Enron.\" \nThe fund manager also blames lower commodity prices, warm weather and poor demand for the recent weak performance in the group. \n\"Energy convergence companies are putting up terrific growth rates,\" he said. \"I don't think they should get the same valuation as a garden-variety utility.\" \nStill, others think the stock market is continuing to make distinctions between the energy traders by taking a harder look at the companies' strategies and financial disclosures. \nEnron's precarious financial situation underscores the importance of accounting issues. Although many of Enron's financial problems aren't solely the fault of mark-to-market accounting issues, there has been growing attention paid to this form of financial reporting because of the earnings volatility it can create. \nAnswers Elude Investors \n\nInvestors are asking hard questions, and not always getting the answers they want. \nUsing mark-to-market methods, a company calculates the fair market value of a commodity position - whether it's a contract, an option, a swap, etc. - at the time, even if the value of the position is realized over a longer period. The problem with this method is the actual cash a company realizes from the position might not be the same value the company calculated in its original assessment. Also, sometimes it isn't easy to calculate the fair value of the commodity position. This is particularly true in instances where the market for the commodity isn't liquid. \nOver time, companies with the highest level of disclosure regarding their mark-to-market gains will most likely trade at higher multiples to counterparts that provide little or no disclosure, said ABN AMRO Inc. analyst Paul Patterson. \nEncouragingly, it appears companies may already be responding to the call for added disclosure. According to a survey Patterson conducted, more companies with energy trading units were willing to disclose the details of their mark-to-market accounting practices during third-quarter conference calls compared with those in the second quarter. \nPatterson said he prefers earnings that are cash-based. \n\"All things being equal, we believe reported earnings that more closely reflect the timely realization of cash have a higher quality associated with them than earnings that do not,\" he said. \nHe expects investors to become smarter and learn to distinguish between earnings growth through accrual accounting and growth fueled by mark-to-market accounting. \nAt the end of the day, it is not a matter of simply producing profits, but being able to say where those earnings came from, said one investor, who manages a pension fund. \nSome investors also may be placing a greater emphasis on the cash flow the energy merchants produce. \nTim O'Brien, portfolio manager of the Gabelli Utilities Fund, said energy merchants that own the physical power assets to back up their trading positions should trade at a premium to an independent power producers and traditional utility companies. Still, the stocks should be valued at less than the growth rate of the company because of their heavy exposures to commodity prices. \nEnergy merchants include companies such as Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Duke Energy Corp. (DUK) and Dominion Resources Inc. (D). \nAccording to O'Brien, the group never deserved to have the price-to-earnings multiples above 20- to 30-times earnings, which were once paid for the stocks. \n\"We all got sucked up by the up-leg of the cycle and forgot just how cyclical these companies are,\" O'Brien said, adding that the average multiple should be in the high single-digits to the high-teens. \nAs for independent power producers - which are companies without regulated operations that own power plants to generate electricity to sell and trade in the wholesale market - the group may wind up being valued on the basis of the replacement costs of the assets in their portfolio, according to O'Brien. \n\"One analogy is that they are basically like commercial real-estate plays,\" O'Brien said. \nThat could mean stocks such as Calpine Corp. (CPN), which is already in the lower-half of its trading range, may have further to fall. \n-By Christina Cheddar, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-5166; christina.cheddar@dowjones.com\n\n\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

We are not interested,\" a top AV Birla group official told Reuters. \nTwo leading Indian business dailies earlier said the group, whose interests range from textiles to cement and carbon black, is eyeing Dabhol to expand its interests in the domestic power sector. \nThe Economic Times and the Financial Express said the group was exploring the possibility of submitting an expression of interest to Indian financial institutions to buy Enron's stake in the company. \nAn official of state-run Industrial Development Bank of India, the leading financier of the $2.9 billion project in the western state of Maharashtra, said he has not heard from the Birla group. \n\"We have not received any official communication from them,\" the official, who did not wish to be identified, told Reuters. \nThe spokesman for Dabhol was not available for comment. \nFIGHTING FOR SURVIVAL \nEnron Corp, which is fighting for survival in the United States amidst investor doubts over its corporate governance practices, owns 65 percent of Dabhol. General Electric Co and Bechtel own 10 percent each, while the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) owns 15 percent. \nDabhol and MSEB have been fighting over payment defaults and high tariffs for over a year. The dispute has affected India's efforts to attract foreign investment in the power sector and caused Enron and its U.S. partners to announce plans to exit the project. \nTata Power Company Ltd, India's largest private sector utility firm, and BSES Ltd, another utility company and a member of India's largest conglomerate, the Reliance Group, are already in talks to buy Enron's stake. \nThe AV Birla Group has adopted the route of mergers and acquisitions in recent years to consolidate its position in key industries. \nLast week, one of its group companies, Grasim Industries Ltd, bought a 10-percent stake in India's largest cement maker, Larsen & Toubro Ltd \nEarlier this year, Indian Rayon & Industries Ltd, another group company, entered the information technology sector by buying out France's Groupe Bull SA's 50.35 percent stake in PSI Data Systems \nBut the group's track record in the power sector has been less than impressive. \nTwo joint ventures with Britain's Powergen Plc to produce over 1,000 megawatts of electricity in two Indian states have not made much headway since they were announced in the mid-1990s.\n\n\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. executives met\ntoday to line up investors for as much as $2 billion of bonds\nconvertible into stock. The company needs the money to operate\nuntil Dynegy completes its $23 billion purchase. Dynegy unveiled\nits plan to make the acquisition on Nov. 9.\n\n     Enron shares and bonds, which opened lower, tumbled after 1\np.m. when no announcement for fresh financing was made. Enron's\n6.4 percent notes that mature in 2006 plunged to 48 cents on the\ndollar, down from 55 cents on Friday. The bonds now yield 26\npercent. Enron shares declined 15 percent, or 70 cents, to $4.01.\n\n     Concern that rival Dynegy may change or cancel its bid for\nEnron has pushed Enron's stock down 55 percent in the past week.\nEnron's shares had plummeted 86 percent since mid-October after\nthe company reported a $618 million third-quarter loss and said\nexpansion into water, telecommunications and retail-energy sales\ncost it $1.01 billion.\n\n     ``You haven't heard anything from Dynegy today, and that is a\nbit scary,'' said Andy Palmer, who doesn't hold Enron bonds in the\n$2 billion he helps manage at ASB Capital Management Inc. in\nWashington.\n\n     Part of the third-quarter charge was connected with limited\npartnerships run by the chief financial officer. He was ousted,\nand the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission started an\ninvestigation into Enron's accounting. The company earlier this\nmonth restated its earnings for the past four years.\n\n                        Talks on $1 Billion\n\n     Under the buyout, Enron investors would receive 0.2685 Dynegy\nshare for each share held. That valued Enron at $10.41 a share, 21\npercent more than Enron's share price that day.\n\n     On Friday, the buyout valued Enron at $10.85 a share, more\nthan double Enron's closing price of $4.71. The widening of the\ndifference between the value of the offer and Enron's stock price\nindicates investors doubt the buyout will go through.\n\n     Shares of Enron traded as low as $3.76 today, rebounding to\nclose at $4.01. The stock was the most active in U.S. trading\nWednesday and Friday. Dynegy dropped $1.15, or 2.85 percent, to\n$39.25. The stock has fallen 30 percent this year. Both companies\nare based in Houston.\n\n     Egan-Jones Ratings Co. lowered its rating on Enron's credit\ntoday to ``BB-'' from ``BB.'' ``Dynegy needs to show its support,\nor Enron will slide,'' the firm said in a report.\n\n     Moody's Investors Service hasn't issued a report on Enron\nsince the company filed its 10-Q quarterly report with the SEC a\nweek ago. The ratings agency's analysts haven't returned calls for\ncomment.\n\n     Moody's cut Enron's long-term credit rating on Nov. 9, though\nit maintained an investment grade.\n\n                          `More Problems'\n\n     ``Time is not Enron's friend,'' said Stewart Morel, co-head\nof investment grade debt research at UBS Warburg LLC. ``There is\nincreased concern in the market that there may be more problems\nthat are yet to be disclosed.''\n\n     On Wednesday, Enron got a three-week reprieve from lenders on\na $690 million note due this week, giving the company more time to\nrestructure its finances. Dynegy Chief Executive Officer Chuck\nWatson said he was ``encouraged'' by the commitment to extend the\nnote payment, as well as the closing of a $450 million credit\nfacility, and that Dynegy remained committed to the merger.\n\n     Terms of the $690 million note were outlined for the first\ntime in the Enron filing a week ago. Enron also said that it has\nless than $2 billion in cash and credit lines left. If the\ncompany's cash reserves run too low, Enron's credit rating may be\ncut below investment grade. That would trigger $3.9 billion in\ndebt repayments for two affiliated partnerships.\n\n     Enron said in the filing that fourth-quarter profit might be\nhurt by a drop in its trading business. Companies such as Aquila\nInc. and Mirant Corp. have reduced their activity with Enron\nbecause of credit concerns.\n\n     ``Should the Dynegy deal fall through, we don't view it\nlikely that Enron would be able to remain as a stand-alone\ncompany,'' Youngberg of Edward Jones said. ``Without Dynegy, the\ncredit rating will fall, causing their trading business to dry up\nfurther.''\n\n     Enron, the biggest energy trader, once handled about a\nquarter of U.S. gas and power transactions.\n\n     Enron's bankers met with leveraged buyout firms and two\nindustrial companies to seek an investment, the New York Times\nreported last week. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc.\nagreed to terms that give each of them a $250 million equity stake\nas part of a transaction to be completed today.\n\n\n\nDynegy Bonds Slip as Enron Purchase May Harm Credit Rating\n2001-11-26 15:16 (New York)\n\nDynegy Bonds Slip as Enron Purchase May Harm Credit Rating\n\n     New York, Nov. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Dynegy Inc. bonds have\nfallen as much as 9 percent this month on investor concern the\nenergy trader's proposed $23 billion purchase of rival Enron Corp.\nwill erode its credit rating.\n\n     Dynegy's 6.88 percent coupon notes due in 2011 are trading at\n$932 per $1,000 face value, down from $1,024 last month, according\nto Merrill Lynch & Co. data. Yield on the debt has risen to 7.9\npercent from 6.5 percent as investors demand more return to\ncompensate for the increased risks of the securities.\n\n     Dynegy's credit is rated ``Baa3'' at Moody's Investors\nService, the lowest rung of investment grade, and ``BBB+'' at\nStandard & Poor's, two levels higher. Each ratings company said it\nmay cut Dynegy's credit rating if it buys Enron, which comes with\nabout $15 billion in debt and a regulatory inquiry into financial\npartnerships set up to keep debt off its books.\n\n     ``If you put Dynegy and Enron together it will have a\ndetrimental effect on Dynegy's credit rating,'' said Tim Nelson,\nsenior credit analyst at U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray Cos. in\nMinneapolis, which holds Dynegy bonds.\n\n     Dynegy's 7.45 percent coupon notes due in 2006 are trading at\n$1,019 per $1,000 face value, down from $1,085 last month,\naccording to Merrill. The notes yield almost 7 percent, up from\n5.4 percent.\n\n     Enron's credit is rated ``Baa3'' at Moody's and ``BBB-'' at\nS&P, the lowest level of investment grade. Both ratings companies\nare reviewing the credit for a possible downgrade and say Dynegy's\nbuyout plan is what's keeping the grades above junk.\n\n     ``I don't think right now anybody knows exactly what Enron\nis,'' said Mark Simenstad, who holds Dynegy bonds in the $5\nbillion he helps manage at Lutheran Brotherhood.\n\n     ``Dynegy has proven to be pretty well-managed over the years\nso you have to give them the benefit of the doubt here,''\nSimenstad said. ``The hope is that if there's something they don't\nunderstand they'll walk away.''\n\n     Dynegy has $3.9 billion of bonds outstanding, most of which\ncome due between 2002 and 2011, according to Bloomberg data.\n\n     Shares of Houston-based Dynegy, which topped $47 two weeks\nago after Chief Executive Chuck Watson said the Enron purchase\nwould boost earnings by at least 35 percent next year, fell $1.30\nto $39.10 in mid-afternoon trading today. Enron's shares, down 92\npercent this year, fell as much as 80 cents, or 17 percent, to\n$3.91, a the lowest since 1987.\n\n\n\nENRON SHARES SLIDES TO ALL-TIME LOW\n\nBy CBS.MarketWatch.com\n\n4:53 PM ET Nov 26, 2001\n\nHOUSTON (CBS.MW) -- Enron shares fell as much as 20 percent Monday,\ncrashing through the $4 level for part to set an all-time low and cast\nadditional doubt on the energy merchant's plan to be acquired by rival\nDynegy.\n\nEnron (ENE) set a new all-time low of $3.76 Monday afternoon before\nclosing at $4.01, off 70 cents. More than 60 million shares changed\nhands, making it the most active issue on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nThe stock has lost about half its value since Dynegy announced an\nagreement to buy Enron on Nov. 9 and more than 85 percent of its value\nin the past month.\n\nMeanwhile, shares of Dynegy (DYN) lost $1.15, or 2.8 percent, to stand\nat $39.25.\n\nThe collapse in Enron's share price has made it more likely that Dynegy\nand Enron will have to renegotiate the terms of their original deal, in\nwhich 0.2685 of a Dynegy share would be exchanged for each outstanding\nEnron share.\n\nHowever, the Financial Times reported that Dynegy remains confident of\nits ability to complete a deal for Enron, which has been seeking $500\nmillion in private equity capital to shore up its finances.\n\n\"We continue to hear reports the Enron's energy marketing and trading\nbusiness, once the crown jewel of the company, has eroded badly with\ncounterparties only willing to do shorter-term deals,\" A.G. Edwards\n&amp; Sons analysts Charles Fishman and Douglas Fischer wrote in a\nresearch note Friday.\n\nEnron investors do not believe that the merger is likely to occur under\nthe current terms, the analysts said.\n\n\n\nChance of Dynegy backing out\n\n_______________________________________________________________________\n\nOn Monday, Michael Heim, also of A.G. Edwards, attributed Enron's\nlatest stock drop to \"growing belief that the likelihood of the (merger)\ndeal is not so likely.\"\n\nHe pointed out that the outlook for Enron is \"not very favorable\" but\nin the meantime, it's doing everything it can to stay \"afloat\" while\nworking on closing the deal.\n\n\nLast week, Enron said it got a bank extension on a $690 million note to\nmid-December. The note was originally set to come due in 2003, but was\nbumped up to Nov. 26 due to a rating downgrade at Standard &amp; Poor's.\n<http://cbs.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?guid=%7B81418CA4%2D11A5%2D4C7C%2DA602%2DCF3DA4BCAA7B%7D>\n\nThe payment by itself is manageable because Enron has about $2 billion\nin cash on its hands, Heim said, but \"the event moves Enron's merger one\nstep closer to the point in which Dynegy is able to exercise the\nmerger's material adverse condition clauses and back out of, or\nrestructure, the merger deal.\"\n\nHeim has a \"sell\" rating on the stock.\n\n\n\n"

The 1999 Beaucastel Chateauneuf du Pape is a profoundly rich=\n, concentrated, classic vin de garde.  Made from 30% Grenache, 30% Mourvedr=\ne, 10% Syrah, 10% Counoise, and the remainder a blend of other varietals, i=\nt is one of the blackest, most opaque-colored Beaucastels of the last decad=\ne.  The bouquet offers aromas of licorice, roasted meats, black cherry and =\nblackberry fruit, and a truffle-like earthy note.  Broodingly backward, for=\nmidable endowed, powerful, and extremely tannic, it will require 8-10 years=\n of cellaring, and should age effortlessly for three decades or more.  Fran=\ncois Perrin compares it to the thrilling 1990, but at this stage, it appear=\ns to me to be more structured and closed than the 1990 was at a similar age=\n.  In any event, it is a great wine, but readers older than 55 should think=\n twice before investing in such a backward vintage.\"Have your own tasting n=\notes?

I=\nt is made from 80% Roussanne and 20% Grenache Blanc, fermented in 80% cuves=\n and 20% barrels, of which 10% are new, and bottled with minimal clarificat=\nion.  Like a top Hermitage, the Perrins subscribe to the theory (and I tend=\n to agree) that this is a wine to drink during its first 2-4 years of life,=\n or forget it for at least a decade.  It takes on an oxidized mid-life cris=\nis between 5-10 years of age, and re-emerges as a completely different anim=\nal around age ten.  Of course, each vintage has its own track record, but i=\nt is a fascinating wine to drink young, as well as an impressive one to hav=\ne after ten years.  The light gold-colored 1999 reveals intense marmalade a=\nnd rose petal, honeyed richness with a touch of spice and toast.  Thick and=\n unctuously-textured, but supported by excellent acidity, it can be drunk o=\nver the next 4! -5 years, and then ignored for a decade.

The Marlin II notes and the Osprey notes\nare currently rated `BBB'. This rating action follows the\nplacing of Enron Corp.'s ratings on Rating Watch Negative by\nFitch.\n\nThe rating of the Marlin II notes is supported by an overfund\naccount (pre-funded interest) and equity commitment from Enron\nin the form of mandatorily convertible preferred stock. The\noverfund account is invested in Enron debt securities (rated\n'BBB+', Rating Watch Negative), with payments used to service\ninterest to noteholders. Payment of principal ultimately relies\non Enron's obligation to remarket mandatorily convertible\npreferred securities. Fitch currently rates Enron's preferred\nsecurities 'BBB-', Rating Watch Negative. In addition, the\ntransaction also benefits from rights under a $125 million loan\nto Azurix Europe Limited, rated `BBB+' by Fitch.\n\nSimilarly, the rating of the Osprey I notes is based on the\nsupport from the assets in the share trust used to support\ninterest payments and an equity commitment from Enron to\nremarket mandatorily convertible preferred stock to fund\nprincipal payments. The mandatorily convertible preferred stock\nhas been issued and is being held in the share trust. The assets\nin the share trust supporting interest payments include Enron\nunsecured obligations (the overfund account) as well as\nquarterly dividend payments on the mandatorily convertible\npreferred stock.\n\nWhile various sources of repayment exist, such as sale or\nliquidation of the underlying assets or an equity offering, in\neach case primary credit support is derived from the Enron\nobligation to remarket mandatorily convertible preferred stock\nif an amount sufficient to repay the notes has not been\ndeposited with the trustee the 120-day prior to the maturity\ndate, which is one of the Note Trigger Events. In the event that\nthe issuance of the preferred stock yields less than the amount\nrequired to redeem the senior notes, Enron is required to\ndeliver additional shares. If Enron cannot or does not deliver\non this obligation, subject to certain standstill periods, then\nthe amount of the deficiency becomes a payment obligation of\nEnron, representing a general unsecured claim. Additional Note\nTrigger Events include a downgrade of Enron's senior unsecured\ndebt below investment grade by any of the major rating agencies\nin conjunction with specified declines in Enron's closing stock\nprice over three consecutive trading days, as well as customary\nevents of default under the notes. It is important to note that\nEnron has not verified that the underlying assets have adequate\nmarket value to fully pay down the associated debt.\n\nFitch will continue to monitor these transactions in conjunction\nwith the ratings of Enron, Corp. and will update investors as\nappropriate.\n\n\nEnron's Debt Falls As Company Draws Down On Bank Loans\n\n10/26/2001\nCapital Markets Report\n(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)\n\nNEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp.'s (ENE) bond and bank debt was quoted lower early Friday following the Houston energy giant's decision Thursday to draw down about $3 billion on its bank loan facilities. \nLate Thursday, Enron said it had taken action to dispel uncertainty in the financial community. Specifically, the company said it drew on its committed lines of credit to provide cash liquidity in excess of $1 billion.\nEnron's 6.4% bonds which come due in July 2006 were hovering just below 80 cents on the dollar, down from around 82 cents on Thursday. \nTrading activity in investment-grade bank debt like that of Enron's isn't as active as the market for leveraged loans made to companies with less than investment-grade ratings. But fixed-income sources noted some offers Friday for Enron's bank debt at around 94 cents on the dollar, still well-above distressed levels. They add that banks may want to try to sell Enron's bank debt, which is now funded following the drawdown, but at a coupon that was negotiated several months ago. \nThat was well before Enron ran into its current market turmoil. Last week, the company reported a $618 million third quarter loss and $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity. The company has said that the Securities and Exchange Commission is conducting an inquiry into transactions it did with Andrew S. Fastow, its former chief financial officer who was replaced on Wednesday. \nMoody's Investors Service rates Enron's senior unsecured debt at Baa1, though it's on review for a possible downgrade. Fitch Inc. and Standard & Poor's both rate the debt triple-B-plus. Fitch also has Enron's debt on review for a possible downgrade, while S&P changed Enron's credit outlook to negative from stable. \nEnron's stock was trading at around $15.87, down 48 cents at around 12.20 p.m. EDT. \nAmong the Enron bank debt that comes due in May 2002 is a $1.75 billion 364-day commercial paper backstop facility. The company also has a $1.25 billion revolving facility that's due in April 2005, according to Loan Pricing Corp. in New York. \nOne distressed debt investor said some of the bank debt comes with a low coupon of around 55 basis points over the London Interbank Offered Rate. \nBanks, the investor said, \"are funding it and not getting paid for the risk at Libor plus 55, even though it comes due in May '02,\" the investor said. \nAnother fixed-income official said that trading desks may start to kick the tires on Enron's bank debt, given the run of fallen angels, or investment-grade companies that have been downgraded to below investment-grade status, within the last year. Among such companies are Lucent Technologies Inc. (LU) and Xerox Corp. (XRX) \n\"As soon as banks have a piece of paper they never expected to be funded, it really changes their perception and some just want to get this stuff off their books,\" this person said. \nSome banks, though, may not be active seller of Enron's debt given that banks' business with big investment-grade companies is relationship-driven. \n\"Banks are not very quick to pull out of a relationship like that,\" the fixed income official said. \n\n-By Joe Niedzielski, Dow Jones Newswires, 201-938-2039; joe.niedzielski@dowjones.com\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

(ENE), he threw out a ray of hope for his company's foundering broadband business. \nEnron Broadband Services had just signed a long-term deal to provide bandwidth for MSN, Microsoft Corp.'s (MSFT) online Internet service, Skilling said. Enron would give more details on the deal later.\nAfter three months without farther word on the deal, Enron has broken its silence by suing Microsoft. \nIn a suit filed Thursday in the district court of Harris County, Texas, Enron claimed Microsoft has failed to live up to terms of the deal. \nThe agreement, signed June 25, called for Enron Broadband to develop and provide network capacity and other services to support Microsoft's offering of high-speed Internet service, according to the lawsuit. \nMicrosoft was required to develop an electronic ordering and billing system for use with all regional Bell telephone companies during an initial phase of the deal, according to the lawsuit. \nMicrosoft has failed to provide that system and other items required in the deal, so Enron isn't required to deliver operational broadband services for the deal, the lawsuit said. \n\nMicrosoft sent Enron a letter dated Oct. 23 saying that if Enron didn't provide an operational broadband system by Oct. 25, Enron would have breached the contract, the lawsuit said. Microsoft then would be entitled to recover damages. \nThe suit also said Microsoft failed to provide monthly subscriber growth forecast required by the deal. \nIn a third breach of the contract, the suit claimed, Microsoft made public announcements about the subject of the agreement without getting Enron's prior approval. \nAn Enron official told Dow Jones Newswires that Microsoft had issued a press release Oct. 15 about the service but that Enron wasn't mentioned in the release. \nA Microsoft news release dated Oct. 15 announced what the company calls MSN 7, a new version of the MSN network which includes high-speed, or broadband, access to the Web. The service was to be available on Oct. 25. \nThe Microsoft release said MSN 7 would deliver \"state-of-the-art\" video and audio through \"dramatically improved\" broadband technology. The new service would extend MSN broadband service \"to more than 29 million households in 45 markets.\" \nBy the end of the first quarter of 2002, the Microsoft release said, the MSN broadband service would be available to more than 90% of U.S. households capable of using high-speed digital subscriber line access. \nThe Enron lawsuit asked that Microsoft be declared in breach of contract. It also asked that Enron be allowed to recover unspecified damages as well as costs stemming from the lawsuit. \nNeither Enron nor Microsoft have responded to requests for comment on the lawsuit. \nThe Microsoft deal is the second failed broadband agreement. In July 2000, Enron and Blockbuster Video, a unit of Viacom Inc. (VIA), announced a deal to deliver movies over the Internet. \nThat deal fell apart in March of this year when Blockbuster said Enron's fiber-optic network couldn't deliver the service on a dependable basis. Enron countered that Blockbuster couldn't deliver the quality and quantity of movies needed for a successful video-on-demand service. \n-By Michael Rieke, Dow Jones Newswires; 713-547-9207; michael.rieke@dowjones.com\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The sales unit had failed to meet bonding requirements intended to protect market participants and the group itself from unpaid bills. \nISO New England, which operates the power grid throughout the six New England states, urged Nepool, the power industry group, to \"initiate termination proceedings\" for Enron Energy Services Inc., according to a letter obtained by the Globe.\nAn Enron spokeswoman yesterday said the company had satisfied Nepool's requirements, and blamed the threatening letter on a series of administrative oversights, including the failure of ISO New England to warn Enron of previous instances when the bond fell below required levels. \n\"It was an administrative snafu,\" said Peggy Mahoney, a spokeswoman for Enron. \"It's fixed. It's no big deal. We didn't get the paperwork in [on time] because it got sent to the wrong desk. It was taken care of on Friday.\" \nAccording to the letter, a Nepool participant faces termination if it has failed to meet its bonding requirements three times over the previous 12 months. \"Having three defaults to trigger that letter does not happen frequently,\" said Ellen Foley, an ISO New England spokeswoman. In the letter, ISO's chief financial officer, Edward McKenna, said his organization \"has been in contact with Enron Energy Services through multiple telephone communications, and to date the financial assurance has not been cured.\" \nBut Mahoney said Enron never received written notification of its previous \"financial assurance\" defaults, which were corrected almost immediately. Therefore, she said, the company was unaware that the current default was the third, which begins the expulsion proceeding. In addition, she said, the current default notice was sent to the wrong person, creating the delay that resulted in the letter. \"We're working with ISO New England to figure that out,\" she said. \nThe recommended termination is an embarrassment to Enron because the firm's director of state government affairs, Daniel W. Allegretti, is the chairman of Nepool's Participant Committee, which organizes and oversees the major membership meetings in the organization. \n\"This is not that unusual within the pool,\" said Allegretti. \"I frequently receive notices of technical defaults.\" As far as posting the new bond to correct the situation, he said, \"We were two and a half days late in submitting paperwork.\" \nThe incident also comes at a particularly sensitive time for Enron. The parent in Houston has been the subject of a financial scandal in which the firm's chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, is accused of profiting from partnerships he oversaw that engaged in billions of dollars of transactions with Enron. The Securities and Exchange Commission is probing those transactions, the company said Monday. Enron placed Fastow on leave Tuesday and installed a new CFO. \nEnron's stock has plunged amid ongoing revelations about the partnerships and their impact on the company's financial strength. The company reduced shareholder equity by $1.2 billion after terminating transactions by one of the partnerships that had been headed by Fastow, according to The Wall Street Journal. Enron lost $618 million in the third quarter. \nYesterday, Enron's shares closed at $16.35, down 6 cents, on volume of 39.1 million shares. \nJeffrey Krasner can be reached by e-mail at krasner@globe.com.\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. \t\n\nFRONT PAGE - COMPANIES & MARKETS: Enron's explanations fail to quell critics' concerns \nFinancial Times; Oct 26, 2001\nBy JULIE EARLE and SHEILA MCNULTY\n\nEnron has put up a page on its website of \"frequently asked questions\" in response to a barrage of analysts' enquiries following last week's controversial results announcement. \nUnfortunately, the US energy group's critics have not been satisfied with the answers. Nor has Wednesday's decision to replace Andrew Fastow, its chief financial officer, quelled all investors' concerns about its highly complex financial affairs. \nHowever, analysts are pleased that Kenneth Lay, chief executive officer, is distancing the group from Mr Fastow and his ties to controversial financing vehicle \"partnerships\". \"It is a step in the right direction and we are happy to see them move,\" says Ronald Barone of UBS Warburg. \"It's not the end of it.\" \nThe shares, which have tumbled since last week's results, ended a shade lower yesterday, off 0.37 per cent at Dollars 16.35. But analysts warn that the shares will continue to languish well below the 52-week high of Dollars 84.87 until the group improves its transparency. \nOne of the frequently asked questions following Enron's results announcement on October 16 concerned \"a Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 840m) reduction in shareholders' equity\". The Dollars 1.2bn was not explained in the news release on the results, but mentioned in passing by Mr Lay in a follow-up conference call. Many analysts confused it with a Dollars 1.01bn charge in the earnings report. \nIt has since been called a \"loss\" and a \"write-off\" and Enron's staff have struggled to explain it in plain language. \nEnron's official position now is that the reduction in shareholders' equity related to a structured finance vehicle in which LJM, a private equity fund formed by Mr Fastow, was an investor. When the decision was made to terminate these vehicles, Enron \"recorded a Dollars 1.2bn reduction in shareholders' equity and a corresponding reduction in receivables. These adjustments were the result of Enron's termination of obligations to deliver Enron shares in future periods\". \nThe confusion over the Dollars 1.2bn has further undermined the credibility of Enron, which is now the subject of an unofficial inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission. \nAnalysts were upset they did not know the adjustment was in the offing and note that it could be seen as increasing the group's debt ratio, which might hurt its debt rating. \nMr Lay held an analysts' meeting to counter charges that Enron was not transparent. But this ended with demands for daily calls with outside auditors to explain its accounts. \"I find the disclosure is not complete enough for me to understand and explain all the intricacies of these transactions,\" said Goldman Sachs' David Fleischer. \nOther analysts are also concerned about potential further write-offs. Salomon Smith Barney's Raymond Niles points to Enron's investments in its Dabhol Indian power plant, its South American investments, and its remaining telecoms assets. Most importantly, he says, they may include several of Enron's other off-balance-sheet vehicles. \n\"Frankly, we have not been able to get enough information on them to evaluate whether there is a problem with them,\" Mr Niles says. Other US energy traders have been distancing themselves from their rival. El Paso said it was facing \"a lot of questions on its accounting practices\". \nAdditional reporting by Julie Earle Enron in turmoil: www.ft.com/enron \nCopyright: The Financial Times Limited\n\n\nEnron Bonds Fall as Company Taps $3 Bln Credit Line (Update3)\n2001-10-26 14:26 (New York)\n\nEnron Bonds Fall as Company Taps $3 Bln Credit Line (Update3)\n\n     (Adds Egan-Jones lowering credit rating in 12th paragraph.)\n\n     Houston, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. bonds and shares\nfell after the company failed to reassure investors its bond\nrating wouldn't be lowered and tapped a $3 billion credit line\nbecause it can no longer borrow in the commercial paper markets.\n\n     Enron's stock has fallen 52 percent in the past 10 days after\ninvestors questioned the company's transactions with affiliated\ncompanies run by its former chief financial officer. The stock\nfell 45 cents to $15.90 in early afternoon trading today.\n\n     ``People are questioning the credibility of management,''\nsaid John Cassady, who helps manage $3 billion of fixed income\nassets at Fifth Third Bancorp. ``It looks like the guy who was\nsupposed to do everything for the benefit of shareholders was\nrunning partnerships for the benefit of himself.''\n\n     Enron is shut out of commercial paper markets, where short-\nterm loans carry lower rates than banks offer. The company will\nuse its credit line to pay off $2.2 billion in commercial paper it\nhas outstanding, Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said.\n\n      The company's 6 3/4 percent bonds which mature in 2009\ndeclined 1 1/2 points to a bid of 84 cents on the dollar and an\noffer of 86 cents. At that price, the bonds, which carry a rating\nof ``BBB+,'' yield 9.53 percent.\n\n     Enron's shares have dropped as investors grew concerned that\nthe company's credit rating will be cut after $1.01 billion in\nthird-quarter losses from failed investments. Enron needs good\ncredit to raise cash daily to keep trading partners from demanding\ncollateral and to settle transactions.\n\n\n                         Dilution Concerns\n\n     Though Enron's bonds have investment-grade ratings, their\nyield at current prices is higher than those of industrial bonds\nthat carry junk ratings. According to Bloomberg data, companies\nwith ``BB'' ratings pay on average 9.16 percent to borrow for\nseven years.\n\n     A lower credit rating may also force Enron to buy back\nholdings in other partnerships with its stock, diluting the value\nof Enron investors' stock.\n\n     Partnerships called Whitewing, Marlin and Yosemite own Enron\nassets they bought with borrowed money. Enron sold the assets to\nthe partnerships to keep debt related to them off its books. The\npartnerships plan to repay the borrowed money by selling the\nassets.\n\n     If Enron loses investment-grade rating, the borrowed money\ncomes due earlier, leaving less time for the partnerships to find\nthe best price for the power plants and other assets. Enron would\nhave to make up any shortfall between what the assets would sell\nfor and the amount of the debt.\n\n     One way would be issuing common shares in exchange for Enron\npreferred convertible shares held by the partnerships. That would\nthin out the holding of every other investor.\n\n     Of the two main bond rating companies, Moody's Investors\nService has the company on watch for possible downgrade, and\nStandard & Poor's lowered Enron's long-term credit outlook to\nnegative. Egan-Jones Rating Co. today lowered its rating on\nEnron's debt to BB+, one notch below investment grade, from BBB-.\n\n                         Other Liabilities\n\n     Enron's liabilities associated with the partnerships amounts\nto at least $3.3 billion, the company has said.\n\n     Enron ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow on\nWednesday amid a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into a\npartnership he ran that cost the company $35 million in direct\nlosses. Enron also bought back 62 million shares from the\npartnership, reducing shareholder equity by $1.2 billion.\n\n     Jeff McMahon, head of Enron's industrial markets group, was\nnamed CFO in a bid to restore investor confidence, Chairman and\nChief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay said in a statement.\n\n--Mark Johnson in the Princeton newsroom (609) 750-4662, or at\n50-4662, or at\n\n\nWeiss & Yourman Law Office Announces Class Action Lawsuit Against Enron Corp.\n\n10/26/2001\nBusiness Wire\n(Copyright (c) 2001, Business Wire)\n\nNEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 26, 2001--A class action lawsuit against Enron Corp. (\"Enron\" or the \"Company\")(NYSE:ENE) and certain of its officers and directors was commenced in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division, on behalf of purchasers of Enron securities. If you purchased Enron securities between January 18, 2000 and October 17, 2001, please read this notice. \nThe complaint charges the defendants with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The complaint alleges that defendants failed to disclose material adverse information and misrepresented the truth about the Company and caused plaintiff and other members of the Class to purchase Enron common stock at artificially inflated prices.\nThis action seeks to recover damages on behalf of defrauded investors who purchased Enron securities. Plaintiff is represented by Weiss & Yourman, a law firm possessing significant experience and expertise in prosecuting class actions on behalf of defrauded shareholders in federal and state courts throughout the United States. Weiss & Yourman has been appointed by numerous courts to serve as lead counsel in class action lawsuits and in that capacity has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars on behalf of investors. \nIf you purchased Enron securities between January 18, 2000 and October 17, 2001, you may move the Court no later than December 21, 2001, to serve as a lead plaintiff of the class. In order to serve as a lead plaintiff, you must meet certain legal requirements. A lead plaintiff is a representative party that acts on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. In order to be appointed lead plaintiff, the Court must determine that the class member's claim is typical of the claims of other class members, and that the class member will adequately represent the class.

It requires a change in the eol system that when someone buys 30 of the 60 offered, it reduces the offer from 20,000 to 10,000.  Right now it has no effect on the daily volumes, thus, I am limited to what size to put out else someone can buy infinite amount at same price until I manually change the price.  \nMeanwhile, I'll give them a calculator to divide by 333.\n\n-----Original Message----- \nFrom: Abramo, Caroline \nSent: Tue 10/16/2001 9:39 PM \nTo: Arnold, John \nCc: \nSubject: lot size eol/renaissance/other funds\n\n\nhi.... is there any way for you to put the same number of lots on the lot size product as you have on the standard MMBtu per day product?\n \nYou have 10 lots out there now for Nov01 and 20,000/ day on the standard... can you offer 60 contracts (20,000*30) on the lots size.. the people that the product was meant for can just click their one or two lots.. its going to be the same price as the standard Nov01 contract right?\n \nThe physical standard is a limitation for funds.. all of them trade lots.. no one wants to sit there and figure out the contracts however easy it is.\n \nI think I can get at least 4 more funds on EOL if you can do just this..these are people outside the Campbell types who can not trade OTC.  EOL is great for funds like Ren whose traders get buy/sell orders at the beginning of the trade day (I assume they get signals on close) and have discretion on how to execute through the day. Versus Campbell who gets a signal and executes orders immediately regardless of liquidity.. its all to do with the way they view slipage\n \nLiz at Renaissance was not giving you the whole picture on how much they trade.. they are an 8 Billion fund.\n \nLast year they traded:\n156,000 crude contracts- most in one day.. 6,000 contracts\n85,000 nat gas- 6,000 highest one day\n40,000 Nickel-1,000 highest one day \n120,000 Ali- 6,000\n52,000 Cu- 5,000\n24,000 Zn- 2,000\n \nThe only other energy counterparty they have is Goldman (this is the case with a lot of the program traders).. they tried MS, but said they were terrible..\n \n \n \n \n "

Morgan analyst who rates\nEnron ``buy.'' ``On wholesale and retail energy operations, Enron\nhas had 35 percent growth in earnings before interest and taxes,\nand bottom-line growth of just under 20 percent.''\n\n     Shares of Enron rose $1.72, or 5.4 percent, to $33.45.\nNorthwest fell 42 cents to $22.99.\n\n     Enron will get less than it hoped from the sale, though\nspokeswoman Karen Denne said the Houston-based company expects to\nbreak even.\n\n     A November 1999 agreement to sell the utility to Sierra\nPacific Resources of Nevada for $3.1 billion fell through in April\nof this year because California banned sales of power plants\nserving the state.\n\n     Regulators had required Sierra Pacific to sell a stake in a\nplant that sells power to California as a condition of its\npurchase of Portland General.\n\n\n                         Oregon Regulators\n\n     Both Northwest and Portland General are based in Portland,\nOregon, which should make it easier for Enron to win clearance of\nthe sale. Oregon regulators can be expected to approve the\npurchase in as little as nine months, Northwest Chief Executive\nRichard Reiten said.\n\n     ``No other combination of companies could achieve as much\npolitical, regulatory, and general support of the citizens,''\nReiten said. ``We operate in essentially the same geographic\narea.''\n\n     Northwest, a gas utility, will pay $1.55 billion in cash,\n$200 million in preferred stock and $50 million in common stock,\nEnron said. Northwest will assume $1.1 billion in debt and give\n$75 million in customer discounts previously agreed upon by Enron.\n\n    Northwest has 525,000 natural-gas customers in Oregon and\nWashington. Portland General has 730,000 customers in Oregon.\n\n    Over the past 10 years, Lay has transformed Enron from a gas\npipeline operator into a company that gets most of its profit\ngrowth from commodities trading.\n\n     Enron no longer wants to own expensive assets such as power\nplants that are under the control of regulators, who limit\nprofitability and often make the assets difficult to sell,\nanalysts say.\n\n     ``This is a sign Ken Lay is tightening up the ship,'' said\nMark Baskir, manager of the $15 million Strong Energy Fund, which\nholds 2,400 Enron shares. ``I feel better about the stock now.''\n\n                           Retail Sales\n\n     Enron's road to becoming a top energy trader in California\nhas been bumpy. It delayed attempts to sell electricity to\nCalifornia residential customers in 1999, saying the state's\nderegulation law made it impossible to profit from small power\nsales. It transferred its retail electricity sales business in all\nstates to NewPower Holdings Inc., a separately traded company\nformed by Enron in October 2000.\n\n     When power prices in western state's soared late last year\nand early this year, some utilities stopped paying for wholesale\npower. Enron has estimated it's owed as much as $500 million for\nenergy sales in California.\n\n     California's two largest utilities, PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas\n& Electric and Edison International's Southern California Edison,\nare insolvent after racking up billions in debt buying power at\nprices far exceeding what state officials would allow them to pass\nto customers.\n\n                         California Battle\n\n     California officials have accused Enron and other power\ntraders of manipulating the state's market. Enron also has\nstruggled with Oregon regulators.\n\n     It was forced to cut power prices to Portland General's\ncustomers by $141 million over eight years, more than double what\nthe company had anticipated when it bought the utility. Oregon\nalso rejected Enron's plans to sell its utility's 14 generating\nplants.\n\n    Enron will keep its stake in Northwest for at least 30 months,\nthe company said in a statement. It will have voting rights\nlimited to 4.9 percent of Northwest's common stock and will have\nrepresentation on Northwest's board.\n\n    Northwest said the sale is expected to close this quarter and\nadd to earnings next year.

The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\n\nPORTLAND, Ore. (AP) - Northwest Natural Gas said Monday it will buy Portland General Electric for $1.8 billion in a deal that will combine the largest natural gas and electric utilities in Oregon. \nThe purchase comes about four years after Enron Corp., one of the largest energy companies in the nation, paid $3.2 billion for Portland General Electric in a bid to expand into the Pacific Northwest and California.\nBut the slow pace of deregulation in Oregon and the California energy crisis prompted Houston-based Enron to start shopping for another buyer shortly after the takeover. \nNorthwest Natural Gas said it expects to close the purchase late next year, pending approval by regulators and its shareholders. \nEnron will receive $1.55 billion cash and $350 million in securities. \nThe deal will create a Portland-based holding company with $5 billion in assets and more than 1.25 million customers. The new company would own more than 2,000 megawatts of generation, 26,000 miles of electric transmission and distribution lines and 12,000 miles of gas mains. \nNorthwest Natural Gas Chairman Richard G. Reiten said the deal would \"help ensure that assets critical to Oregon's economy and environment will be locally-owned.\" \nThere will be an undetermined number of job cuts, he said, although all union contracts will be honored. \nThe deal brought immediate criticism from one of the state's leading consumer watchdog groups. \nBob Jenks, executive director of the Citizens Utility Board, said he was concerned about the heavy debt Northwest Natural Gas will carry under the deal and the gas company's recent efforts to lobby the Legislature to bypass regulators. \n\"They've tried to politicize rate proceedings,\" Jenks said. \"If that's going to happen, and PGE rate cases are fought out in the Legislature and the governor's office, then I don't think that's going to be in the interest of PGE customers.\" \nAnalysts said the deal makes sense because the two utilities can cut a lot of costs in their overlapping service areas. \nBut Dan Fidell of A.G. Edwards & Sons said analysts and investors also are wary of the heavy debt load on NW Natural. \n\"Their balance sheet is going to suffer, at least in the near term,\" Fidell said. \"They're probably looking at downgrades in their credit rating.\" \nEnron earlier attempt to sell Portland General Eelctric fell through last March. It has seen stock prices fall in recent months as it moved into investments outside its core business, including an Internet company that took a beating in the stock market. But in morning trading Monday, Enron shares rose 77 cents to $32.50, which analysts said was partly due to heavier investment in strategic energy companies following news about the U.S. attack on terrorist outposts in Afghanistan. \n--- \nOn the Net: \nEnron: http://enron.com \nNorthwest Natural Gas: http://northwestnatural.com \nPortland General Electric: http://www.portlandgeneral.com\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

All available capacity on the interconnector was used on Monday, c ompared with only half on Friday. \nAlso influencing prices was that, like last week, Enron started the day shor t, and then tried to push prices down before buying in large volumes, traders sa id. \n\"Basically it looks like Enron have gone into the winter short, thinking tha t pre-NETA jitters would make everyone else go long, and so far it looks like th ey're winning that bet,\" said a trader. \nNo one at Enron was immediately available for comment. \nDay-ahead base load traded at GBP17-GBP17.35/MWh, down from Friday's trading \nfor Monday base load at GBP17.30-GBP17.70/MWh. \nDay-ahead peaks traded at GBP18.50-GBP19.50/MWh. \nDay-ahead extended peaks traded at GBP19.30-GBP19.50/MWh. \nWeekend base load traded at GBP16.30/MWh, down from Friday's prices for last \nweekend at GBP17/MWh. \nWeek 42 traded at GBP17.50-GBP17.55/MWh, down from Friday's prices at GBP17. 70-GBP17.75/MWh. \nEnron's visible buying in the spot market is all the more striking given tha t its own 2000MW facility at Teesside is runing at just over half its maximum ou tput. \nThis likely reflects the high price of natural gas relative to electricity, a trader reckoned. \nPlant has been in flux recently with a 400MW unit at Seabank II struggling t o maintain consistent output, while British Energy's 581MW unit at Heysham 1 cam e back online on Friday, and was generating 500MW by Monday afternoon. Both 535M W units at Dungeness B remain offline, while traders expect at least one to come \nback online soon. \nForward market prices were down beginning with November, but not trading in volumes large enough to identify a trend. \nOn the U.K. Power Exchange, within-day prices peaked during settlement perio d 39 at GBP36.95/MWh. Lowest prices were for settlement periods 7-11 at GBP1/MWh . Volume was 12,412MWh in 24,824 contracts. On the Automated Power Exchange, the \naverage weighted day-ahead price was GBP18.63/MWh, up from Friday's price of GB P16.01/MWh. \nThe Meteorological Office expects Tuesday's temperatures to be 2 degrees Cel sius warmer in the southeast and Yorkshire and Lincolnshire. Countrywide, temper atures are forecast to in line with historical norms. \nThe Balancing Mechanism Reporting System said demand will peak Tuesday at 38 ,094 MW, with off-peak demand hitting a low of 25,908 MW. Demand peaked Monday a t 39,094 MW. \nThe following forward contracts traded Monday.

The transaction was anticipated since Friday when the companies confirmed a Wall Street Journal that the two were talking.\nUnder the terms of the planned sale, Northwest will acquire the Enron unit for $1.55 billion in cash and $250 million in seller-financing securities. Northwest also agreed to cancel a $75 million payment obligation from Enron to Portland General that was related to Enron's purchase of Portland General in 1996. \nNorthwest also is assuming $1.1 billion in existing Portland General debt and preferred stock. \nDuring the conference call, Northwest officials said they expect the acquisition to close in the fourth quarter of 2002, following approval of Northwest's shareholders and regulatory agencies, including the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. \nThe company has already secured the necessary financing, officials said. \nNorthwest shares recently traded at $23.10, down 31 cents, or 1.3. On Friday, the stock closed down 9.9% to $23.41 in anticipation of the acquisition. \nEnron shares, meanwhile, have gained $1.41, or 4.4%, to $33.14. \nEnron had previously agreed to sell Portland General to Sierra Pacific Resources (SRP) for $3.1 billion, but the deal was called off six months ago, in part because of complications stemming from the California power crisis. \nEnron's decision to sell Portland, an electric utility with $5 billion in assets and $3.9 billion in enterprise value, is an example of Enron's strategy to sell its physical assets and focus on its energy trading activities. \n\nNorthwest Natural Gas Chairman and Chief Executive Richard Reiten said the acquisition of Portland General will have \"solid accretion\" under old accounting rules, and \"double-digit accretion\" under the new accounting rules pertaining to the treatment of goodwill. Under the former accounting rules, goodwill was amortized to expense. \nReiten didn't provide any specific estimates for the earnings of the combined companies. \nIn an interview, Reiten said the ability of the transaction to increase the combined company's earnings potential will be helped by a number of factors including the companies' overlapping service areas and combined customer bases. \nReiten expects to consolidate customer billing, call centers and meter reading. \nPrior attempts by Northwest and Portland General to initiate joint meter reading for about 350,000 customers already have yielded about $1 million in cost savings, Reiten said. \nAlso, the acquisition gives Northwest the ability for non-speculative trading around the combined company's natural gas and electric assets, he added. \n\"The opportunities are exceptional for a utility in the Northwest. That's why we are so confident about the ability of this transaction to add to the bottom line,\" said Reiten, who served between 1989 and 1996 as the company's president and chief operating officer and as a member of its board. \nThe combination will result in staff reductions, but Reiten said he couldn't quantify how many. He said some of the reductions would occur through early retirement incentives and though attrition. \n-Christina Cheddar, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-5166; christina.cheddar@dowjones.com\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. \t\n\n\nNorthwest Natural's CEO on Portland General Purchase: Comment\n2001-10-08 13:36 (New York)\n\n\n     Portland, Oregon, Oct. 8 (Bloomberg) -- Richard Reiten, chief\nexecutive of Northwest Natural Gas Co., comments on the company's\nagreement to buy Portland General Electric Co. from Enron Corp.\nfor $2.8 billion in cash, stock and assumed debt.\n\n     The transaction would consolidate the natural gas and\nelectric utilities in Portland, Oregon. Enron bought Portland\nGeneral for $3.1 billion in 1997. A 1999 agreement to sell the\nutility to Sierra Pacific Resources of Nevada for $3.1 billion\nfailed in April because of regulatory delays.\n\n     How Northwest, which has a market capitalization of about\n$580 million, will finance the $2.8 billion purchase:\n\n     ``We will issue $150 million of common equity at close. Our\nFinancial plan calls for another $150 million, three years out, in\n2005.'' The company also expects to borrow $1.4 billion, and it\nwill assume $1.1 billion in Portland General's debt.\n\n     On regulatory approval:\n\n     ``We expect a nine-month to 12-month regulatory approval\nperiod. Our first full year as a combined company would be 2003.\nWe expect to begin paying down debt that first full year, and we\nexpect double-digit accretion to earnings the first full year.\n\n     ``No other combination of companies could achieve the\nefficiencies these companies can, because we operate in\nessentially the same geographic area. No other combination of\ncompanies could achieve as much political, regulatory and general\nsupport of the citizens.''\n\n     On potential cost savings:\n\n     ``We expect significant efficiencies. Common meter reading,\ncommon call centers (customer service). All support services and\nadministrative functions that are duplicated, we can bring them\ntogether.\n\n     ``We have a wonderful match of the gas utility's interstate\npipeline and gas storage that can be used to enhance the gas-fired\ngeneration facilities of Portland General.\n\n     ``We have a storage field 15 miles from a 550-megawatt\ngenerating plant. We'll be able to trade around those assets, in\nnon-speculative trading, something that Portland General has\nbecome very good at under its ownership by Enron. Those assets\nwill enhance trading to bring costs down for the gas-fired\ngeneration and give us more options.''\n\n     On the investment profile of the holding company that will be\nformed to own the two utilities:\n\n     ``We see ourselves as a strong, combination utility with a\ngood, secure dividend, a fair price paid for our assets, and good\ngrowth in earnings. We're confident we'll get regulatory support\nfor our structure.''\n\n"

The company took $1.01 billion in charges and writedowns on ill-fated investments, measures Enron executives said credit rating agencies were comfortable with.\nUBS Warburg analyst Ronald Barone said on Wednesday he was \"not thrilled\" by the announcement during a conference call to discuss third-quarter earnings. And for good reason. \nMoody's Investors Service subsequently issued a statement saying it had placed all of Enron's long-term debt obligations on review for a possible downgrade. \n\"There appears to be much more work ahead before the lingering credibility issues that have vexed this company in the past are fully resolved,\" Barone said. \nThe writedowns on poorly performing assets and a more detailed breakdown of the company's operations went some way to appeasing Wall Street after a tumultuous year in which Enron's stock lost about two-thirds of its value, but analysts said they were not about to let Enron off the hook just yet. \nBear Stearns analyst Robert Winters said he remained concerned about Enron's quality of earnings and cash flow. \nWinters said he believed Enron would have liked to take even bigger charges and writedowns, but was unable to do so without putting its credit ratings at risk, which could adversely affect some of the company's financing arrangements. \n\"Problem assets and overvalued assets on the balance sheet remain, particularly overseas,\" he said. \nOne such asset is Enron's 65 percent stake, valued at $1 billion, in the Dabhol power plant project in India, which has been stalled because of a long-running payments dispute with its only customer, a local utility company. \nEnron's stock closed down $1.64, or 4.85 percent, at $32.20 on Wednesday. \nFor the year to date the stock is down about 61 percent, underperforming the Standard & Poor's utilities index , which has fallen some 24 percent over the same period. \nEnron was a Wall Street favorite last year when its stock posted a gain of 87 percent, driven by enthusiasm for the company's broadband plans and the success of its EnronOnline Internet energy and commodity trading platform. \nBut the stock has fallen sharply this year as sentiment toward broadband soured, new chief executive Jeff Skilling resigned after just six months in the job and wrangling continued over the Dabhol power plant project.\n\n\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. \t\n\nUSA: UPDATE 1-RTO seen key to boosting New England power supply.\nBy Scott DiSavino\n\n10/17/2001\nReuters English News Service\n(C) Reuters Limited 2001.\nNEW YORK, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Energy companies said the future development of new power plants and transmission lines in the U.S. Northeast hinges, in part, on setting up a Northeast Regional Transmission Organization (RTO). \nRTOs are predominantly for-profit groups established to bring all of a region's high-voltage transmission lines under central control while ensuring equal access to the lines to all power suppliers seeking to market their goods across the grid.\nThe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), which oversees the interstate wholesale power market, believes RTOs will benefit consumers by enhancing competition among power providers, in turn improving service and driving down rates. \n\"If FERC can drive the Northeast RTO to closure in a reasonable period of time, it will accelerate the development of new transmission and generation,\" Enron Corp.'s managing director of global government affairs, Rick Shapiro, told Reuters. \nHouston-based Enron is the nation's top energy marketer. \n\"How and when the RTO gets implemented will radically impact the market. It's crucial to the development of the market in New England,\" Mirant Corp. spokesman Ray Long told Reuters. \nEnergy provider Mirant, of Atlanta, has 1,400 megawatts (MW) of generation in New England. The company is currently adding another 700 MW to its Canal station in Massachusetts. \n\"Once we get the permits for Canal, we will reassess whether to proceed with the project. A big part of that assessment will depend on the RTO process,\" Long said. \nTHE NORTHEAST RTO \nFERC wants to see four super-regional RTOs created in the U.S. - in the Northeast, Midwest, Southeast and West. \nSeveral regions have taken long strides toward developing RTOs, including a not-for-profit model proposed in the Midwest and rival for-profit plans vying for FERC approval in the West. \nFERC Chairman Patrick Wood, seeking to spur the development of RTOs, favors giving utilities until Dec. 15 to join one or forfeit their right to sell electricity in the wholesale market, though the commission has not voted on this plan. \nThe Northeast RTO will include New England, New York, the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) region and possibly parts of eastern Canada. \nFERC said it wants the Northeast RTO to be built on the PJM market platform and to include the best practices of the New England and New York markets. \nPJM Interconnection, which operates the power grid in parts of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware, Virginia and Washington, D.C., is the nation's only fully functioning RTO. \n\"The process FERC set in place to establish one RTO in PJM, New York and New England is going to get us where we need to be in terms of having a vibrant wholesale market,\" Long said. \nLong said Mirant determined a single Northeast RTO would save more than $440 million annually by eliminating the \"artificial borders that now exist between New York, New England and PJM.\" \nAn administrative law judge, acting as a mediator for FERC, considered three proposals for creating the Northeast RTO. \nThe three plans were proposed by interested parties, including Mirant and Enron, and the region's grid operators - the New York Independent System Operator (ISO) in New York, ISO New England in New England and PJM. \nLast month, the judge asked the FERC to decide who will govern the Northeast RTO and what the timetable is to put the plan in place. The judge favored a plan put forward by the New York ISO and ISO New England. \n\"If FERC implements the RTO plan proposed by PJM in 2003, consumers could save $1.5 billion ... $440 million a year ... over the New York/New England plan, which would not be implemented until 2006,\" Long said. \nUnder the PJM plan, PJM would overlay its current market model across the entire region, while adopting some of the best practices of the other markets. \n\"Although nothing is perfect, PJM is widely accepted as the best market in the region. New York and New England, which are younger markets, are still works in progress with some bugs to work out,\" Enron's Shapiro said.\n\n\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

(ENE), the nation's largest natural gas trading company, isn't ready to let the regular report on U.S. natural gas storage inventory die, a company executive said Tuesday. \nBecause the American Gas Association has said it will discontinue its weekly gas storage report at the end of the year, Enron would like to see another organization take over the report, said John Lavorato, president and chief executive of the company's Americas Wholesale Services unit.\nSpeaking at a meeting with analysts, Lavorato said the storage report is important for the gas industry to keep track of industry fundamentals. \nWithout a regular report on storage gas inventory, the gas industry can expect less frequent but greater price changes than seen in the past, he said. \nThe Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration publishes monthly data on gas storage, but the information isn't as timely as data the AGA reports each Wednesday. \nThe EIA issued its latest gas storage report Oct. 9. It showed the amount of gas in storage at the end of July. The data comes from reports filed by operators of gas storage facilities. \nIt also showed estimates of the amount of gas in storage at the end of August and September. Those estimates are generated by a computer model. \nWednesday's weekly storage report from the AGA will show estimated inventory as of Oct. 12. The AGA estimate is based on reports from gas storage facilities. That data is then run through an AGA computer model to generate the report. \nLavorato said he would like to see the EIA, the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America or consultants like PIRA Energy Group, an international energy consulting firm, take over reports on storage inventory. \nINGAA is an industry trade group representing gas pipeline companies in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. They manage many of the gas storage facilities. \nLavorato would like to see a new report based on data that could be audited, he said. \nHe said he thinks the AGA has found itself \"in the middle of something it didn't want to be in.\" Originally intended for use within the gas industry, the weekly AGA report has become high-profile, and is even watched by equity markets, he said. \nSome industry participants have criticized the AGA report, wondering whether it can be manipulated by companies that supply data to the AGA. Many of those companies also trade physical gas and gas futures. \nWhen the AGA has revised storage figures from previous reports, gas prices have sometimes reacted wildly. \n\n-By Michael Rieke, Dow Jones Newswires; 713-547-9207; michael.rieke@dowjones.com\n\n\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Bush\nwill nominate Joseph Kelliher, a policy adviser to U.S. Energy\nSecretary Spencer Abraham, to fill the open seat on the Federal\nEnergy Regulatory Commission, the White House said.\n    \nIf the Senate approves Kelliher, a former Republican counsel\nfor the House Energy and Commerce Committee, the commission will\nhave its full five members for the first time since Pat Wood,\nBush's first FERC appointee, became chairman Sept. 1.\n     \n``I hope they speed him through the process,'' said\nCommissioner Nora Brownell, a Republican who was appointed by Bush\nearlier this year. ``He is a thoughtful person who knows how to\nwork through issues.''\n    \nKelliher's nomination comes as the commission has pledged to\nclosely monitor and investigate abuses in the electricity and\nnatural gas markets and promote competition. In the next month or\nso, it is due to choose which groups will run the electric power\ngrid around the country, an important step in deregulating the\nnation's power markets.\n     \nA former power industry lobbyist, Kelliher would fill the\nopening left by the departure of Curt Hebert, a Republican\nappointed by President Bill Clinton and named chairman by Bush.\nHebert left the commission Aug. 31 to join Entergy Corp. after the\nWhite House made it clear Bush planned to make Wood the chairman.\nWith Kelliher, FERC will have three Republicans and two Democrats.\n     \n``Kelliher will be a valuable final addition to the team now\nworking actively to finish the transition to truly competitive and\ndynamic power markets,'' said the Electric Power Supply\nAssociation, which represents competitive power sellers such as\nEnron Corp.\n     \nThe commission is responsible for ensuring fair wholesale\nelectricity and natural gas prices.\n\n\n\nEnergy Regulators May Loosen Price Caps on Western Power Sales\n2001-10-17 14:59 (New York)\n\nEnergy Regulators May Loosen Price Caps on Western Power Sales\n\n     Washington, Oct. 17 (Bloomberg) -- Federal regulators are\nconsidering changes to wholesale price caps on electricity in\nCalifornia and 10 Western states, which power producers hope will\nallow them to charge more when supplies in the region are tight.\n     \nThe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission plans a public\nconference Oct. 29 to discuss altering the pricing formula. The\ncommission established caps in April and June, after skyrocketing\nelectricity costs led to insolvency for California's largest\nutilities, units of PG&E Corp. and Edison International.\n\n     ``We have heard and understand that people do think the\nsolution was very California-centric, and it was,'' FERC Chairman\nPat Wood said, indicating changes in the formula are likely. ``But\nCalifornia's needs were very urgent at the time.''\n\n     While commissioners declined to say what they would be\nwilling to change about the pricing formula, they want to fine-\ntune the caps before the winter, which is the peak period of\ndemand and may yet cause another jump in prices, Wood said.\nChanges could be made next month.\n\n     The current pricing formula is based on the most-expensive\npower generated in California. Enron Corp., Sierra Pacific\nResources and other sellers of power to California want the\nformula to consider costs from all generators in the region.\n\n     Enron blamed the formula for a July 2 blackout in Nevada,\nwhen sellers withheld supply because local prices were too low\nbased on the highest cost of supply then being offered in\nCalifornia.\n\n                         Lower Power Costs\n\n     Though the cost of wholesale power in California has dropped\nsince the commission ordered the first emergency cap on April 25,\nWood said the Western states may face another shortage of power\nand high prices this winter.\n\n     The Pacific Northwest depends on hydropower for much of its\nenergy needs, and rainfall has been below normal this year. Part\nof the shortfall in power last year and early this year was the\nresult of a drought that reduced power available from dams.\n\n     ``I remain concerned about that part of the country,'' Wood\nsaid. ``It has not been raining a whole lot out there.''\n\n     The average price for a megawatt-hour at the California-\nOregon border in September was $24.91, down from $313.70 in April.\nA megawatt-hour is enough electricity to power about 750 average\nCalifornia homes for an hour.\n\n     On the agenda for this month's conference is a proposal to\nlink the formula to the price of natural gas, a fuel used in many\ngenerating plants.\n\n     ``I'm not predisposed for or against specific changes,'' said\nFERC Commissioner Nora Brownell. The Oct. 29 conference will help\nthe commission determine aspects of the price control that the\nparties involved agree are working and those that are not, she\nsaid.\n\n                             Surcharge\n\n     In a related matter, the commission also may halt the 10\npercent surcharge it permits generators to charge in California to\ncover the costs of collecting bad debt. The insolvent California\nutilities now have plans to pay off their debts.\n\n     For power sellers in the West, the current price caps often\nrequire utilities to sell their excess power at a loss, Enron,\nSierra Pacific and other marketers said in statements to the\ncommission. They said the price they sometimes pay for power is\nhigher than the cost of supply from the most-expensive producer in\nCalifornia.\n\n     ``The determination of the proxy price should not be limited\nto California generators,'' Enron said in a government filing. It\nshould be ``determined by the least-efficient generator in the\nentire West.''\n\n     Power marketers also should be allowed to recover\n``justifiable costs above the proxy prices,'' Enron wrote.\n\n     California officials had demanded the price controls after\nPG&E's Pacific Gas & Electric and Edison's Southern California\nEdison racked up more than $14 billion in power-buying losses.\n\n     The caps were extended to other Western states -- Oregon,\nWashington, Arizona, Nevada, Wyoming, New Mexico, Colorado,\nMontana, Idaho and Utah -- in June because some said generators in\nthe West could simply get around the cap by selling outside\nCalifornia when prices were higher elsewhere. The caps don't\nexpire until Sept. 30, 2002, though they can be changed.\n\n     California said before the price cap was extended to other\nstates that it sometimes had to outbid buyers in neighboring\nstates at prices above the caps to buy enough electricity to avoid\nblackouts.\n\n     On July 2, Sierra Pacific cut supplies to 10,000 customers\nfor 45 minutes when temperatures soared and three power plants\nwere idled. It couldn't buy 50 megawatts of power in the spot\nmarket, partly because of suppliers' concerns with the federal\ncap, company spokesman Paul Heagan said at the time.\n\n\nEnron Faces Questions Over Limited Partnerships, WSJ Reports\n2001-10-17 10:11 (New York)\n\n\n     Houston, Oct. 17 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. is facing\nquestions over agreements with two limited partnerships run by its\nchief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, the Wall Street Journal\nreported.\n\n     Fastow set up LJM Cayman LP and LJM2 Co-Investment LP with\nthe approval of Enron's board. The partnerships have engaged in\nbillions of dollars of complex hedging transactions with Enron\ninvolving company assets and Enron stock, the paper said. It isn't\nclear from U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings what\nEnron received in return.\n\n     Enron said about $35 million of its $1.01 billion charge\nreported yesterday was connected with the partnerships and\ninvolves the ``early termination ... of certain structured finance\narrangements,'' the paper said. Chief Executive Officer Kenneth\nLay said in an earlier interview that related transactions\ninvolving top managers aren't unusual, the paper said.\n\n     According to the arrangement, the general partner, made up of\nFastow and at least one other Enron employee, received a\nmanagement fee of as much as 2 percent annually of the total\namount invested, the paper said, citing the LJM2 offering\ndocument. Fastow declined to comment, the paper said.\n"

Wherever the most trading is during that day, that's where we'll be,\" Gold said. \nSCREEN TRADING \nEnron has also become a major player in metals screen trading since July last year, when the company announced the first physical metals transaction on its internet trading platform EnronOnline (www.enrononline.com). \nThe system differs from the screen trading systems operated by the London Metal Exchange (LME) and UK-based metals and energy broker Spectron in that the trading platform is open to a broad range of users but Enron is the sole counter-party in each transaction. \nAt the end of August the company amended EnronOnline to make markets for selected clients only in three months copper and aluminium for maximum 200-lot transactions, compared with the standard 20-lot markets on the system. \nIn addition to metals, EnronOnline trades a range of products, from oil to plastics and emission allowances to credit derivatives. Enron announced the one millionth transaction on the system in May of this year.\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The commission says the handoff is critical to the establishment of competitive power markets, as utilities with positions in the market are seen as unlikely to allow competitors equal access to the grid. \nPower traders like Enron Corp. (ENE) support the effort, while some utilities and state regulators have opposed the assertion of federal authority. \nIn an effort to jump-start the sluggish process, FERC has outlined a plan to divide up control of the country's power grids among four regional operators - one each in the Northeast, Southeast, Midwest and West. \nBut while utilities still control much of the grid elsewhere in the country, transmission systems in the Northeast are already run by three independent wholesale market operators. FERC has told those operators to merge, and has indicated a preference for modeling the new market on that run by Mid-Atlantic operator PJM Interconnection LLC. \nA unified Northeast power market would be the world's largest - processing $9 billion in energy sales a year, handling 110,000 megawatts of electricity and serving a population of 54 million, according to the New York ISO. \nSeeking Other Options \n\nThe Maryland Public Service Commission, along with regulators from Virginia and the District of Columbia, filed motions in August to stay FERC's order, saying the commission had overstepped its authority. \nThe Maryland regulators will ask a federal court to block FERC if it moves forward with its plans to consolidate the three market operators - New York ISO, ISO New England Inc. and PJM - said Robert Harris, the commission's assistant manager of external affairs. \nThe commission last week asked U.S. Senator Barbara Mikulski. D-Md., to require FERC to explore options to ease the flow of power between markets short of a forced consolidation. \n\"This proposal is unnecessary, reckless and risky,\" the PSC wrote. \nThe PSC held public hearings on a unified Northeast power market Oct. 3 and 4, and plans to send the comments it received to FERC next week. \nThe New York ISO and ISO New England said they aren't opposed to a consolidated market, as long as it incorporates the best practices from each of the three existing markets. \nThe New York ISO, along with ISO New England, also wants each of the three regional markets to have equal representation on the board governing the merged market. \nNew York's market operator also questioned whether centralizing control of a Northeast power market with one operator in one location would increase its vulnerability to electronic or other attacks by terrorists. \nFERC will hold a series of workshops next week to discuss issues related to the development of independent transmission operators across the country, including the need to clear bottlenecks and guard against attempts to manipulate the market. \nAs reported, new FERC Chairman Pat Wood III said the commission will spend a day listening to the concerns of state regulators. The commission has also agreed to study its contention that consolidating markets will pay off for consumers, Wood said. \nMirant Corp. (MIR) recently commissioned a study that showed a combined Northeast power market could save consumers $440 million a year. \n-By Kristen McNamara, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-2061; kristen.mcnamara@dowjones.com\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Voluntary redundancies were also asked for, sources at the meeting said.\n\"They said they are restructuring the business, and will no longer execute trades on the floor after Friday,\" one said. \nThis implies that ScotiaMocatta, which is one of 12 ring-dealing members (RDMs) on the LME, could relinquish this status, although sources at the meeting said this was not made clear. \nNo-one from ScotiaMocatta in London was available to comment on Wednesday. \nSeparately, Enron Group said its commodities trader Enron Metals would also lose jobs as part of a Europe-wide staff reduction programme. \nOn Tuesday, Bank of Nova Scotia said in Toronto it was scaling back its base metals trading desk and laying off traders, transforming ScotiaMoccata into a \"niche player\", due to the economic downturn. \nThe bank said the decision does not affect its precious metals division. \nBank of Nova Scotia purchased Mocatta Metals as it was known in September 1997. It is also one of the five members of the twice-daily London gold fix - it is the oldest bullion dealing house in the world, dating back to 1671. \n\"We are still staying in the base metals business, but it will be more focused as a niche player in structural products,\" Scotiabank spokeswoman, Diane Flanagan told Reuters in Toronto. \nFlanagan confirmed there would be layoffs at the bank's base metals desk, but refused to say how many employees would be affected. \nIf ScotiaMoccatta were to give up RDM status, it would bring LME ring-dealing numbers down to 11. The RDMs are the only firms entitled to trade on the open-outcry floor. \nIn the LME's tiered membership, associate broker clearing members (ABCMs) are the second tier of membership - they have all the rights and privileges of LME membership, but cannot trade during the open-outcry trading sessions. \nLME director of corporate affairs Jonathan Haslam said on Wednesday that any announcement about a firm's membership status would have to come from the company concerned. \nDOWNTURN IN METALS BUSINESS HITTING HARD \nTrading conditions in base metals have deteriorated this year, with prices, volumes and revenues all falling, against a background of a global economic slowdown, worsened by the September 11 attacks on the U.S. \nThis climate has hit all trading companies, and ScotiaMocatta's business has declined markedly, sources said. \n\"They have gone from a position of being on the acquisition front to becoming a niche player. That highlights the way their business has declined in the last six months,\" a source close to the company said. \nThere had been persistent talk that ScotiaMoccata had been looking to acquire other LME RDMs. In 2000, it sought to buy RDM Rudolf Wolff, a unit of Canada's Noranda. Wolff was eventually purchased by MG Trading, now known as Enron Metals \nThis year it was said to be negotiating to buy another RDM, although that ultimately came to nothing. \nLME RING DEALING NUMBERS CONTINUE TO FALL \nLME ring-dealership numbers have declined since the mid-1980s, when there were some 30 companies on the floor. This is partly due to consolidation, but also due to some firms relinquishing their status in the wake of the Sumitomo Corp copper scandal in 1996. \nNow, there are significantly more ABCMs and the trend towards consolidation and contraction is likely to continue, as their costs are much lower than being a ring-dealer. \nTo run a floor operation, with telecommunications and associated staff charges, probably costs between one and two million stg a year. \n(With additional reporting by the Toronto Newsroom).\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

With more gas-fueled power plants in the works, the company thinks it would find a market in Florida. \nEl Paso Corp. and AES Corp. also have proposed undersea pipeline projects, although Enron's Calypso project has moved the furthest in the approval process. Judging from the state's comments on Enron's proposal, all three projects will face difficult questions over their safety and environmental impact. \nJust before it reaches land, for example, the pipeline would pass through Port Everglades, a busy center of commerce that could be full of peril for a high-pressure gas pipeline. \n\"The pipeline will be routed through an area that has experienced chronic disturbances such as dredging, ship groundings, high ship traffic entering and leaving Port Everglades and storm events,\" states the memo, prepared by Jayne Bergstrom, an environmental specialist who prepared a series of questions for the company. \n\"Large vessels have caused significant damage to Broward County reefs in recent years, including a 506-foot cargo ship, a freighter driven ashore during a February 1998 storm, a 348-foot Panamanian vessel that washed ashore a month later, and incredibly, a 360-foot nuclear-powered sub, the USS Memphis, in February 1993. Is this the safest route for a high-pressure gas pipeline?\" \nEnron spokesman John Ambler said the pipeline probably would be 30 to 40 feet below the sea floor in the port, well protected even if a ship sank or ran aground directly over it. Just outside the port, the pipeline would ascend to 3 feet below the floor, but that would be in a rocky area that's closed to ships, he said. \n\"We're in the process of developing a response to all of these questions,\" he said. \"We're in an ongoing dialogue, and we're optimistic about being able to resolve these concerns in a way that will allow the project to move forward.\" \nThe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will conduct a public hearing tonight on the environmental impact of the Enron project. The public will be allowed to make comments or ask questions of the agency's staff. \nThe meeting will be at 7 p.m. at the I.T. Parker Community Center, 901 NE Third St., Dania Beach. \nAs the pipeline approaches Broward County's coastline, it would pass through bands of coral reefs, important habitats for marine life. The company plans to drill horizontally under the reefs to avoid harming them. But it also would drag pipes over them in two areas before inserting them through the holes, according to the state. \n\"Coral reefs deserve protection for their intrinsic natural value,\" the memo states. \"In addition, the economic, tourism, fishing and recreational resources of South Florida depend on healthy coral reef ecosystems. Calypso staff and engineers have not sufficiently demonstrated to staff that the project cannot be redesigned to avoid sensitive marine resources.\" \nWhile the company has stated that the impact would be both temporary and insignificant, the memo states that the company has not explained how this could be so. The state estimated that the project would have an impact on about 15 acres of coral reefs and adjacent habitats. \nGiven the damage the reefs already have suffered from pollution and other sources, the memo questions whether any pipelines should be routed directly to southeast Florida. Instead, it says it may be better to route them to the north, through areas without reefs, then connect to the pipeline system on land. \nAmbler said that the company was trying to find ways to avoid dragging the pipes along the reefs. \nAll three pipeline projects will be reviewed by a series of federal, state and local agencies. \nDavid Fleshler can be reached at dfleshler@sun-sentinel.com or 954- 356-4535.\n\nMAP; Caption: Staff graphic/Renee Kwok Map: (color) Fort Lauderdale - Enron's proposed pipeline would run from Freeport through Port Everglades. \nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Reliance and Oil & Natural Gas Corp., India's\nbiggest oil producer, together own 70 percent of the exploration\ncompany and have an option to decide the operator after Enron\nquits, Reliance spokesman Yogesh Desai said.\n\n     The purchase would gave BG a 30 percent stake in the Tapti\nand Panna-Mukta oil and gas fields, as well as 63 percent of an\nuntapped deposit on the west coast of India. The assets hold more\nthan 170 million barrels of oil and gas. BG declined to comment.\n\n     BG will invest ``hundreds of millions'' of dollars to double\nproduction in the Tapti field by 2004 if the other two partners in\nthe venture contribute as well, Nigel Shaw, chief executive\nofficer of BG India Pvt. told reporters last week. ONGC has\nalready claimed its right to operate the fields.\n\n     Before agreeing with BG, Enron rejected bids from its Indian\nventure partners, ONGS and Reliance, as well as from the nation's\nbiggest refiner, Indian Oil Corp.\n\n     India's gas production fell 11 percent to 1999 from 1997 as\nOil & Natural Gas Corp., the state explorer, made no significant\ndiscoveries in 15 years. Insufficient supplies of gas have hurt\ngrowth in the country's fertilizer and chemicals industries and\nhampered upgrading of its power plants, still mostly coal-fed.\n\n     The government expects a gas deficit to triple in the next\nsix years unless new wells are drilled or existing fields expand\nsales.\n\n     Domestic bureaucracy has already thwarted efforts in India by\nElectricite de France and Cogetrix Energy Inc., which have pulled\nout, while Enron is locked in a price dispute with authorities.\nThe government is the sole buyer of gas and power from producers\nand the sole seller to distributors.\n\n\nLME Says Scotiamocatta to End Open-Outcry Floor Trade (Update2)\n2001-10-10 11:59 (New York)\n\nLME Says Scotiamocatta to End Open-Outcry Floor Trade (Update2)\n\n\n     (Adds bank quotes in second, fifth paragraphs.)\n\n     London, Oct. 10 (Bloomberg) -- The London Metal Exchange said\nScotiamocatta, a metals-trading unit of the Bank of Nova Scotia,\nwill cease open-outcry transactions on the LME floor.\n\n     It was not immediately clear when the company will end floor\ntrading, said Caoimhe Buckley, a spokeswoman for the exchange, the\nworld's biggest metals-trading bourse. The bank is planning to cut\nabout 20 base metals staff in London, said Pam Agnew, a\nspokeswoman in Toronto, though its floor dealing is unaffected for\nnow. ``At this time, it's business as usual,'' she said.\n\n     Scotiamocatta is the latest defection from the LME, whose\nnumber of floor traders has more than halved to 11 in the past\ndecade because of declining margins. This year, the price of\ncopper has dropped 23 percent and aluminum has declined 17 percent\nas slowing economies cut demand and reduce trading commissions.\n\n     ``It detracts from (the LME's) standing as a marketplace\nbecause it's another one gone,'' said Richard Starsmeare, head of\ncommodity and trade finance at Raiffeisen Zentralbank in London.\n\n     The bank's decision to cut its London metals staff is related\nto the ``downturn in the economy,'' Agnew said.\n\n     The LME's director of corporate affairs, Jonathan Haslam,\nlater said the exchange couldn't officially comment on\nScotiamocatta's role at the exchange.\n\n     ``The LME wishes to make clear that it has made no formal\nstatement about the position of the Bank of Nova Scotia,'' Haslam\nsaid in a statement. ``Any statements about their future trading\nmust come from them.''\n\n     The LME's other floor-trading members, or ``ring dealers''\ninclude Enron Metals Ltd. and Refco Overseas Ltd.\n\n\nBin Laden 'look alike' arrested in India\nBBC News\nOctober 9, 2001\nBy Frances Harrison in Delhi \nIndian police detained a bearded man in the western border area of Rajasthan on suspicion that he might be the world's most wanted man, Osama Bin Laden. \nThe man was released after two hours of questioning which established that he was in fact a Hindu and also worked for an American company. \nPolice in the town of Jaisalmer bordering Pakistan said they saw a man with a flowing beard and black scarf driving along the national highway in a jeep. \nThey chased the man, took him to the police station and politely asked who he was - clearly concerned they might have apprehended Osama Bin Laden fleeing Aghanistan via Pakistan. \nUS company \nThe bearded man told the police he was an engineer working with the American company Enron on a wind energy project in the area. \nA telephone call to the company confirmed this and one policeman told the man that he should be thankful he wasn't living in the United States because he would have definitely been shot so strong was his resemblance to Osama Bin Laden. \nThe man, who turned out to be a Hindu and not a Muslim, was freed immediately. \nBut not before a crowd of curious villagers had gathered outside the police station eager to catch a glimpse of the man who's been dominating the news. \n"

It helps us discuss it internally.\n\nRecently our internal compliance folks have discussed the \"give-up risk\".\nSpecifically, what guarantee do we have that the executor's (Enron) FCM will\naccept the block trade and get it to the exchange on behalf of our clients?\nThere is some concern that there might be limits imposed by the FCM due to\nissues such as credit and the high volatility of NG.\n\nThey have requested we sign a four (or more) party give-up agreement between\nCampbell, Enron, your clearing firm(s) and our clearing firm(s).  Is this\nthe SOP as you envision the NYMEX EFS?  We are at the point where the\nspecific documentation issues are the main obstacles to moving forward.  If\nwe buy 1,000 NG from you, how do we know your FCM can guarantee acceptance\nof the trade for further give-up?  Your legal feedback is welcome.\n\nThanks,\nCDY\n\n\n========================================================\n\nThe information transmitted in this email is intended for the named\naddressee(s) only.

Pipeline subsidiary `A-` rated\nsenior unsecured debt at Northern Natural Gas Co. and\nTranswestern Pipeline Co., are also placed on Rating Watch\nNegative.\n\nThe rating action primarily relates to the negative capital\nmarket reaction to recent disclosures by the company. The\nloss of investor and counterparty confidence, if it\ncontinues, would impair Enron's financial flexibility and\naccess to capital markets, therefore, impacting its ability\nto conduct its business. On Oct. 16, 2001, Enron announced\na $1 billion after-tax charge to earnings to be taken in\nthe third quarter of 2001 and a reduction of balance sheet\nequity by $1.2 billion relating to the unwinding of\nstructured transactions. Since that time, there have been\nseveral damaging news reports on the company and its\nmanagement. More importantly, investors have voiced\nconcerns. Enron's common stock price has plummeted and\nspreads on its debt have widened.\n\nThe company has attempted to quell rumors and has publicly\nstated that it has adequate liquidity to conduct its\nbusiness. Approximately $1.5 billion of unused liquidity is\navailable under committed bank lines.\n\nAn additional concern is that certain structured\ntransactions of the company including Marlin Water Trust II\nand Osprey could unwind. While various sources of repayment\nexist, such as the sale or liquidation of underlying\nassets, or an equity offering, primary credit support is\nderived from the Enron obligation to remarket mandatorily\nconvertible preferred stock if an amount sufficient to\nrepay the notes has not been deposited with the trustee 120\ndays prior to the maturity date or upon a note trigger\nevent. In the event that the issuance of the preferred\nstock yields less than the amount required to redeem the\nsenior notes in either case, Enron is required to deliver\nadditional shares. If Enron cannot or does not deliver on\nits obligation, then the amount of the deficiency becomes a\npayment obligation of Enron, representing a general\nunsecured claim. While trigger events include a downgrade\nof Enron's senior unsecured debt below investment grade by\none of the major rating agencies in conjunction with\nspecified declines in Enron's closing stock price over\nthree consecutive trading days, Enron would have a\nforebearance period of 60 days as long as an attempt was\nbeing made to register the shares. The total amount of\nMarlin and Osprey debt is approximately $3.2 billion. Enron\nhas not verified that the underlying assets have adequate\nmarket value to fully pay down the associated debt.\n\nWhile capital market uncertainties have escalated, Fitch\nhas no information to indicate that there are any\nfundamental problems with Enron's core wholesale, retail,\nand pipeline businesses. Fitch expects to be in contact\nwith the company on a continuing basis to both monitor\nongoing events and address strategic, longer-term issues.\n\n\nSTOCKWATCH Enron higher after dismissing CFO Fastow\n\n10/25/2001\nAFX News\n(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd\n\nNEW YORK (AFX) - Share of Enron were higher in opening trade, after the company dismissed its chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, due to his past involvement in running two partnerships, in which Enron had invested, dealers said. \nAt 9.56 am, Enron was up 1.13 usd, or 6.95 pct, at 17.55. The DJIA was down 138.60 points at 9,207.52, the S&P 500 index was down 15.95 pts at 1,069.00 and the Nasdaq composite down 39.02 at 1,692.52.\nEnron said it named Jeff McMahon CFO to replace Fastow, after announcing Monday that the Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into the Fastow-related transactions. \n\"In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO,\" said chief executive Kenneth Lay in a statement. \nEnron shares have fallen sharply in recent days on concerns over financial transactions made with the two partnerships, LJM Cayman LP and LJM2 Co-Investment LP, which analysts said could affect future earnings and which have prompted class action suits against the company. \nMcMahon, who had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron's Industrial Markets group, had quit his job as treasurer last year, after voicing concerns within the company about Fastow's role in running the two partnerships, according to the Wall Street Journal. \nThis morning, Salomon Smith Barney analyst Raymond Niles downgraded Enron to \"buy- speculative,\" from \"buy-high risk\", to reflect his concerns that \"lingering uncertainty over financial practices may begin to impair Enron's commercial operations.\" \n\"This is the least likely outcome, in our view, but one whose likelihood has increased over the last week as questions continue to be asked,\" he said. \nng/lj For more information and to contact AFX: www.afxnews.com and www.afxpress.com\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

(ENE), but they have made almost no changes in\npolicies concerning the top trader of North American power and gas, the\ncompanies said Thursday. \n\n  The concerns have arisen because Enron, which accounts for about a quarter of\nthe trade in the country's power and gas markets, has seen its share price fall\nby a third this week due to uncertainties about its extremely complex financial\nstructure. \n\n  Moody's has put Enron's credit on watch for possible downgrade, and some of\nthe company's debt is trading like junk bonds in the secondary market this\nweek. \n\n  \"We have made no changes to our credit policy concerning Enron,\" said John\nSousa, chief spokesmann for Dynegy Inc. (DYN). \"It's business as usual.\" \n\n  Williams Cos. (WMB) spokesman Jim Gipson said that his company, too, has made\nno changes and has no concerns about Enron's credit. Another Top 10 power and\ngas trading company, Aquila (ILA), has also left Enron credit unchanged. \n\n  Other companies expressed concern, though they've taken little if any action.\n\n  \"Like everyone else in the marketplace, we're proceeding with caution,\" said\nLora Kinner, director of credit for Tractebel Energy Marketing, the North\nAmerican subsidiary of the Belgian company Tractebel S.A. \n\n  Kinner said the company is just looking for more information and doesn't\nexpect to make any drastic changes. \n \n\n\nCalif Guarantees Allow Williams To Book Power Revenues\nBy Andrew Dowell\nOf DOW JONES NEWSWIRES\n\n10/25/2001\nDow Jones Energy Service\n(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)\n\nNEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Clarifications by California as to what electricity transactions the state will back enabled Williams Cos. (WMB) to book $180 million in power sales from the previous period as third-quarter revenues, the company said Thursday. \nThe revenues came from power Williams sold through the California Independent System Operator, which runs the state's wholesale power market and clears and settles transactions.\nThe state of California has paid more than $11 billion for power bought directly from suppliers, but has yet to pay for any ISO power since it took over the job of buying power for the state's ailing utilities in mid-January. Two weeks ago, however, the state made clear for the first time which ISO transactions it would back. \n\"It's that fact that has allowed us for the first time to recognize dollars from sales to the California ISO,\" Williams Chief Operating Officer Steven Malcolm said on a conference call Wednesday. \nWilliams reported third-quarter net income of $221.3 million on revenues of $2.81 billion, up from $121.1 million on revenues of $2.33 billion in the same period the year before. \nWilliams is now in talks with California to secure payment for its ISO sales. The process is complicated by the state's role as guarantor of transactions undertaken on behalf of the utilities, which aren't creditworthy enough to buy power for themselves. The ISO didn't envision third-party guarantors when it set up its settlement process, and state accounting rules require more detailed bills than those sent out by the ISO each month, state power officials have said. \nThe state says it has set aside $1.2 billion to cover ISO transactions. \nAs reported, suppliers including Williams had charged the state with deliberately muddling the repayment issue to keep power flowing for free. \nWilling To Renegotiate \n\nSeparately, Williams' officers also said the company was willing to discuss reworking its long-term contracts with California, provided the result benefited both parties. \nCalifornia Gov. Gray Davis is under heavy fire for having locked the state into contracts running as long as 20 years at prices negotiated at the peak of a market that has since collapsed. \nBoth sides could potentially benefit from changes to the length of the term of the contracts or the specifics of power-supply obligations - perhaps freeing up supply that Williams thinks it could get more money for on the spot market, Malcolm said. \n\"We're always willing to sit down with a customer,\" Malcolm said. \nWilliams hasn't been approached by the state to renegotiate the contracts, Malcolm said. \nAny attempt by California to force through one-sided changes is unlikely and could backfire for the state by disrupting plans for new power plants, he said. \n\"To the extent contracts are changed, financing is going to go away,\" he said. \nDownplaying Enron Opportunities \n\nWilliams downplayed its ability to capitalize on the recent troubles of market-leader Enron Corp. (ENE), saying it focuses on large, long-term structured deals, not the high-volume, physical-market transactions that Enron dominates, Malcolm said. \nAlso, TradeSpark - the Internet-based energy exchange in which Williams is a partner - is limited for now in its ability to expand and take volume from Enron's proprietary system EnronOnline because of the horrific losses operator Cantor Fitzgerald (X.CFZ) suffered in the attacks on the World Trade Center. \n\"That's interrupted the rapid growth we were seeing,\" Williams Chief Executive Keith Bailey said on the call. \nEnron, which accounts for about a quarter of the trade in the country's power and gas markets and which makes a market for those commodities on EnronOnline, has seen its share price fall by a third this week due to uncertainties about its extremely complex financial structure. \nThose concerns have raised questions about the business model of EnronOnline, a platform on which Enron is the counterparty in all trades. Those concerns could eventually boost volume on neutral exchanges like TradeSpark. \n\"We continue to believe in the neutral platform that TradeSpark offers,\" Malcolm said. \nTradeSpark LP was formed by eSpeed Inc. (ESPD), Cantor Fitzgerald (X.CFZ), Shell (RD) unit Coral Energy, Dominion (D), Koch Energy Trading Inc., TXU Corp.'s (TXU) TXU Energy unit and Williams Cos.'

That was a much steeper drop than the 0.9% decline forecast by economists surveyed by Thomson Global Markets. \nMeanwhile, the Labor Department reported that the number of Americans filing new claims for state unemployment insurance rose to 504,000 for the week ended Oct. 20. That was more than the 500,000 jobless claims expected by economists. \nThe Labor Department also said that the employment-cost index rose 1% in the third quarter, slightly more than expected. The indicator measures changes in compensation costs, including wages and salaries, as well as costs for employee benefits. \nLater, at 10 a.m. EDT, the National Association of Realtors is expected to say that 5.26 million existing homes were sold last month, down from the 5.5 million sold in August. \nPrior to release of the economic news, S&P futures had pointed to a weaker opening on Wall Street, after the ECB left rates alone despite growing political pressure for another rate cut to help the stumbling European economy. \nIn addition to pouring over Thursday's economic reports, investors will spend much of the session sorting through a mountain of earnings reports, said Peter Cardillo, director of research at Westfalia Investments. \nAmong companies that announced quarterly earnings so far, Dow Chemical said third-quarter net income plunged 84%, hurt by weak demand, substantial price declines and a slew of charges mostly related to acquisition expenses and restructuring at Dow Corning. \nAmong other stocks to watch, Enron on Wednesday replaced its finance chief, Andrew Fastow, capping a tumultuous day in which the Houston powerhouse saw its stock price continue to fall sharply. \nStates suing Microsoft are hiring one of the nation's top trial lawyers, signaling they may seek a harsher antitrust remedy than the White House. Meanwhile, the software giant's Windows XP formally makes its debut Thursday. \nIn key overseas markets, stocks were mixed. London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-Share Index was down 1.2% in intraday trading, while Frankfurt's DAX was 0.9% lower. Earlier in the day, Japan's Nikkei 225 average closed with a gain of 0.7%, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose 0.2%. \nIn Wednesday's session, Wall Street continued to shrug off disappointing earnings news, and focused instead on hopes that low interest rates and the government's economic-stimulus program will produce a recovery. \nTechnology issues saw much of the buying, with the Nasdaq Composite Index rising 27.10 points, or 1.6%, to 1731.54. The Dow industrials inched 5.54 points, or 0.1%, higher to close at 9345.62, despite substantial losses in two of its components, Eastman Kodak and AT&T, which issued weak outlooks. \nIn major U.S. market action Wednesday: \nMajor stock indexes advanced. But on the Big Board, where 1.34 billion shares traded, 1,374 stocks rose and 1,743 fell. On the Nasdaq, 1.89 billion shares changed hands. \nBonds gained. The 10-year Treasury note rose 13/32, or $4.0625 for each $1,000 invested. The yield, which moves inversely to price, fell to 4.588%. The 30-year bond was up 23/32 to yield 5.330%. Early Thursday, the 10-year note was up 10/32 to yield 4.553% while the long bond was 17/32 higher, yielding 5.303%. \nThe dollar was mixed. Late in New York, it traded at 122.87 yen, up from 122.68, while the euro rose against the dollar to 89.35 U.S. cents from 89.07. Early Thursday in New York, the dollar bought 123.17 yen and traded at 88.27 cents to the euro. \nFor continuously updated news from The Wall Street Journal, see WSJ.com at http://wsj.com. \nCopyright (c) 2001 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. \nAll Rights Reserved.\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Common Stock\n\nNEW YORK, NY -- (INTERNET WIRE) -- 10/25/01 -- Kaplan Fox\n(kaplanfox.com) has filed a class action against Enron Corp. and\ncertain of the Company's officers and directors in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Southern District of Texas.  The suit is\nbrought on behalf of all persons or entities who purchased the common\nstock of Enron Corporation (\"Enron\") (NYSE: ENE) between January 18,\n2000 and October 17, 2001, inclusive (the \"Class Period\").\n\nThe complaint charges Enron Corp. and certain of its officers and\ndirectors with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\nThe complaint alleges that during the Class Period, defendants\nengaged in asset and securities sales to closely related affiliates\nand interested parties, which disguised Enron's true financial\nposition.  Many of the details of these transactions were hidden from\nthe public.  Defendants used these asset sales to falsely improve\nEnron's balance sheet, thereby maintaining Enron shares at an\nartificially inflated price.  Certain Enron executives, who held\npositions in the affiliates that presented clear conflicts of\ninterest, reaped millions of dollars in personal gains from these\ntransactions.\n\nThe complaint further alleges that during the Class Period, Defendants\nmade misleading statements regarding the potential value of Enron's\nBroadband business, in order to artificially boost Enron's share\nprice.  With knowledge that Enron's Broadband business would never\npost a profit and was seriously overvalued, Defendants continued to\nmake misleading statements about the Broadband business in order to\nmaintain the share price at its artificially inflated levels.\nDefendants used the artificially inflated value of Enron's Broadband\nbusiness to hedge against, in order to gain millions of dollars in\nfinancing.  Defendants failed to disclose the risk of these financing\narrangements.  Defendants hid the true nature of Enron's earnings,\nits hedging, its businesses, and the correct state of Enron's\nfinances from its investors and the market, further artificially\ninflating Enron's share price.  While the stock was artificially\ninflated for the above reasons, Enron executives engaged in extensive\ninsider trading, gaining personal proceeds of approximately $482\nmillion during the Class Period, before the public became aware of\nthe above practices.\n\nPlaintiff seeks to recover damages on behalf of the Class and is\nrepresented by Kaplan Fox & Kilsheimer LLP.

Seventy-six\n              million shares yesterday, down fifty percent in the last\n              two weeks.

Anyone who does any trading in\n              energy apparently, you know, uses Enron Online, so anything\n              that destabilizes Enron to a great extent could destabilize\n              the whole energy trading arena and...\n\n              Cramer:  Go ahead, say it!  Say what you're thinking!  No\n              one has said it yet.  We know the truth.  We believe that\n              Enron caused a national short squeeze.  They knew every\n              single number in this gas situation.  They wrecked the\n              California utility system and profited from it.  That's my\n              bet.  My bet that this--they had--look, they were the\n              market maker.  Imagine if Instinet knew what you were going\n              to be buying and took it ahead of you.  I think they\n              cornered the market for electricity for about four months,\n              made a huge fortune and now the company is unraveling and\n              when someone--when the Justice Department gets in there\n              we're going to discover this.\n\n              Kernen:  Let's see what happened...\n\n              Haines:  Now, wait a second...\n\n              David Faber, co-anchor:\n\n              Whoa, whoa, whoa!

Here's\n              yesterday's trading--\n\n              Haines:  Wait a minute.\n\n              Kernen:  Well, I just want to say that the guy is gone now.\n              That's the new news here.

What's\n              interesting--\n\n              Faber:  He's the CFO--\n\n              Kernen:  But he's a new CFO.\n\n              Faber:  --who benefitted personally from some of these\n              off balance sheet partnerships.\n\n              Cramer:  Mark, you know, I'm not on thin ice here, I'm not\n              on thin ice.\n\n              Haines:  I just want to make sure we understand that this\n              is your theory.\n\n              Cramer:  This is my theory.\n\n              Haines:  OK.\n\n              Cramer:  It is just a theory.  It is my opinion.  But I\n              think we've got to find out more about that short squeeze\n              that occurred.\n\n              Haines:  OK.\n\n              Cramer:  We need to find out whether it was orchestrated.\n\n              Kernen:  The new CFO might help regain some credibility for\n              the company because he was the old treasurer who left that\n              position a year or so ago because of some disagreements\n              with how Mr. Fastow was doing business apparently.  So now\n              he's back as CFO and we'll whether that calms the market\n              down.\n\n              Faber:  Well, what they need to do-- Joe, they need to come\n              clean.  I mean, that is what all the investors in Enron and\n              those who've left the company as investors over this last\n              week have wanted.  Let's see everything; be as transparent\n              as you possibly can be; tell us exactly what we need to\n              know.  And as much as they need to come clean with their\n              investors, they need to come clean with their trading\n              counterparties because that is really what people are\n              concerned about.\n\n              Kernen:  Why is the credit worthiness issue such a big\n              deal?  Anyone who does trading with them, if their credit\n              worthiness were to go--if their credit rating were to go\n              down, how would that affect energy trading?\n\n              Faber:  Well, you want to know that they're going to be\n              there on the other side and make good on the trades.\n\n              Kernen:  I guess you would, wouldn't you?\n\n              Faber:  Right.  Not that they aren't, but why would you--if\n              you can trade with seven other guys--seven other companies,\n              maybe you cut back a little bit on your exposure there.\n\n              Kernen:  Now, why would--\n\n              Faber:  And that would hurt their core business.\n\n              Kernen:  Why are people expecting some type of action from\n              the credit agencies, not because of the stock price, right?\n              Because of something that could unravel--\n\n              Faber:  Because of something related to these liabilities\n              they may have--\n\n              Kernen:  That they don't know about at this point.\n\n              Faber:  --that they may have with regard to funding some of\n              these off balance sheet partnerships that they backstopped\n              in terms of borrowing that went on at the project level at\n              the off balance sheet partnership.  Will it be a liability?\n              They don't know.  But that's one of the reasons--\n\n              Kernen:  We're talking hundreds of millions or billions?\n\n              Faber:  They don't know.\n\n              Kernen:  But there were billions of dollars in limited\n              partners?\n\n              Faber:  Yes.  About three billion in financing, I think is\n              what some analysts estimated.\n\n              Kernen:  This is a pretty big number.\n\n              Faber:  Yeah, they can get to most of that with the assets\n              that they have in the partnerships themselves.\n\n              Kernen:  I use a six month chart to show what's happened\n              over the last two weeks.  You got to look at here.  But if\n              we went back a year, you'd see eighty as far as the high\n              for Enron.  Now we're at sixteen.\n\n              Faber:  Everybody else took a hit yesterday.  Dynegy got\n              hurt.\n\n              Kernen:  Well, I got Dynegy next.  Don't--  Here we go.\n\n              Faber:  I'm sorry.  I'm getting a little excited.\n\n              Kernen:  You are.\n\n              Faber:  Enthusiastic about your charts.\n\n              Kernen:  There's a weekly chart of Dynegy, and you know\n              what's coming next, don't you?  Now I'm worried about the\n              utility average.  I've worried about the transportation\n              average a lot in my career.  Mark, now the utilities have\n              replaced my worries.  I'm angst-ridden.  Did you see this\n              chart?  We're breaking below the--\n\n              Cramer:  That's a positive, not a negative, Joe.\n\n              Kernen:  What's wrong with Cramer today?  What happened?\n\n              Cramer:  I'm all fired up!\n\n              Faber:  He really is.  My, God, he's got the DOJ getting\n              all crazy, the FBI, the CIA.  You going down to En--you\n              going down to Houston yourself?\n\n              Cramer:  I may just have to.  I may have to clean up that\n              whole city.\n\n              Kernen:  Jim, why would the--that's the--now getting down\n              to the lows, I mean, the other averages have come back\n              quite a bit from the post-attack lows, the utilities are\n              retesting those.  That's not something to worry about?\n\n              Cramer:  No, because I think there's a lot of money going\n              into more cyclical issues.  I think the economy is showing\n              signs of getting better.  The consumer is certainly much\n              stronger than we thought.  The base book didn't say the\n              corporate was strong, but the consumer is strong.  Much\n              stronger than before.\n\n              Kernen:  All right.  In the past people have worried about\n              the utility averages being a leading indicator, though.  I\n              don't--we're talking about four hundred to two-ninety at\n              this point.  That's a long way.\n\n              Cramer:  This average has got a lot of problems to it, but\n              I still think that--\n\n              Kernen:  It's no longer the--\n\n              Cramer:  --you sell this as safety.  We don't want safety\n              as much as we want a little bit more reciprocality.\n\n                        # # #\n\n\n\n"

We are losing money on avoidable problems and gaining a bad reputation in the market.  Lets get Derek and Michelle together Tuesday afternoon.\n\n2 of our counterparties are writing letters of complaint.. here's a sample of some of the quotes we have heard from the 10 counterparties we have added in the last 6 months.  \n\n\"I shouldn't have to spend my time decomposing the invoices and confirmations you send out\" \n\"It has been 10 days since we traded and we haven't received a shred of paper to give us the details of the trade\" \n\"We are being told in a confirm something different than we are being invoiced for\" \n\"We did not trade 300 contracts per day, it was per month - do you guys even think before you type\" \n\"I am a CFO and an accountant and I can't decipher what you are trying to confirm here\" \n\n\nFrom a business dinner where a client of ours was speaking casually to large industrials and endusers. One, upon the mentioning of B2B exchanges said \"they WILL NOT ever trade on EOL again because the backoffice procedure was such a nightmare.. they couldn't rely on the accuracy or timeliness of the confirm.  This was a captive client who and needs to trade... who will not show us their flow again. \n\nThe latest is the most disturbing:\n\n\"we just want to do a small trade to test your system. We have heard it is a nightmare but want to see for ourselves - I mean how difficult can it be to book the purchase of 50 lots of crude\" And still 5 days later they do not have one paper to show the details, not one phone call to confirm the trade...nothing.  We even warned the BO that this was a new customer and to make best eforts to make sure the process runs smoothly and efficiently. Well, clearly we failed\n\nWe do not understand what is going on in the back office.  Is it that they are too disconnected from our daily operations to understand how integral their accurracy is to our business?  Is there too much turnover? How are they trained?  Who is in charge of the \"backoffice\"?  There seems to be a different manager for every step of the process.. who co-ordinates all their efforts?  Does anyone care?  Ok.. I'll stop.. For our part, we have Michelle coming up to NY for a week in December (we wanted this to happen as soon as she started but did not work for her).\n\nWe have to stop this before we lose clients (which we will).  \n\nAll the problems are being caused by the following:\n\n1. Our inability to generate an accurate position report for our clients.  This has already cost us money this year. Our clients do 10 trades a day.. they are constantly in and out of positions.. it is imperative that we get these right.  As well, this report is our ONLY check to make sure deals are entered and entered correctly into the system.\n\nThere are hundreds of books at Enron.  We have postions on with dozens of them.  We currenttly do not have an automated mechanism to pull deals from every book in one shot.  We have to select books one by one.. this method will always result in books being ommmitted given our deal flow.\n\nMichelle is in charge of this process.  We need a IT person on this yesterday.  Michelle is spending most of her day verifying the validity of the report she generates.  Robyn, Russell, and I check it everyday.. there are always mistakes.\n\n2. There is a breakdown in the backoffice functions after Michelle collects the tickets we write and verbally confirms them.  There is no check after they have been imput.  There are ALWAYS imput errors.  Michelle needs to check every deal after its entered into the system going forward.  \n\nWe also have NO set procedures for the bookings of deals.  We have no idea where our job ends and the book admin's starts.. for non standard deals like gas dailies and swaptions we need to know the exact process from start to finish.\n\n2a. Confirms are sent immediately after deals are entered.. what if deals are imput incorrectly? the confirm goes out anyway resulting in mass confusion at the client.  Going forward, confirms need to be delayed until we can confirm that everything about the deal is correct.\n\n2b. Invoicing.. there have been dozens of occassions where the amounts we are invoicing do not match the deals done.. \n\n3. EOL- We are pushing hard to get counterparties on here.. we have signed Renaissance up (a 10B program fund) but I shudder to see how EOL will fair at these tasks.  \n\n4. Credit- All of our clients are margined.  If deals are in the system incorrectly, the wrong MTM goes to the client.. another mis-match.  We work closely with credit since we need to collect initial margin from some clients.. this amount changes daily- we need someone who can get on the phone with clients and explain these numbers through.. again, we are doing this now.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n "

The last 12 months have been extremely successful for both our senior National Teams and our Youth National Teams and 2002 promises to be exciting on all fronts.\n\nThe U.S. Men's National Team qualified for our fourth straight World Cup, setting the stage for an exciting 2002 tournament, while the U.S. Women took their first steps toward the 2003 Women's World Cup by building on the successful launch of the WUSA this past summer. In the year ahead, our men will be focused on the Korea/Japan World Cup, where we will square off against Portugal, South Korea and Poland in June. We are confident that with your support and the right preparation, we will have a successful tournament. For the U.S. Women, our goals are no less tangible, with preparation for the 2003 Women's World Cup qualifying becoming the focus of our activities.\n\nFor our youth national teams, we saw our U-17 and U-20 Men's teams qualify for FIFA's bi-annual World Youth Championships in those age brackets. In 2002, our Under-19 Women's National Team will have the opportunity to compete in the first ever FIFA Women's World Youth Championship, with qualifying scheduled for May in Trinidad & Tobago and the actual tournament set for Canada in August. This is real progress for the development of the women's game and we expect our team to successfully qualify and then compete for the title of this first-ever event.\n\nIn all of the world championships, we have the opportunity to measure ourselves against the best teams in the world, and that helps to motivate our athletes. But it is the support we receive from our U.S. Soccer family and fans that inspires our players. Again, thank you for your support throughout the year and into the future. We look forward to a successful 2002.\n\nSincerely,\n\nBruce Arena                               April Heinrichs\nHead Coach & Technical Director           Head Coach & Technical Director\nU.S. Men's National Team                  U.S. Women's National Team\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTo end your membership in ussoccerfan.com, please visit http://membership.ussoccer.com/member/unsubscribe.sps?msmid=1 and fill out an unsubscribe request.

Under the agreement, the signa=\ntories pledged to cut emissions to 1990 levels by 2010 and by 10% below tha=\nt level by 2020. Those cuts are to be followed by even deeper reductions. I=\nt is the most ambitious goal set by state governments and it was supported =\nby three Republican governors, two Democrats and one Independent from Massa=\nchusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Vermont and Maine.=20\nNo single state or region can make a substantial reduction in the gases tha=\nt contribute to global warming. Moreover, much of the success of state and =\nlocal efforts relies on voluntary compliance from industry.=20\nStill, advocates of state and local initiatives are confident that there is=\n enough public support to ensure broad cooperation in the private sector.=\n=20\n\"Public demand for action on climate change increased when the United State=\ns was not a part of the [international] agreement. It had a powerful impact=\n on the thinking of all kinds of people, including governors and heads of l=\narge companies,\" said Tom Peterson, director of domestic policy for the Cen=\nter for Clean Air Policy in Washington.=20\nThe center was created in 1985 by a bipartisan group of governors to promot=\ne economical solutions to air pollution.=20\n\"This is a way [for states] to distinguish themselves from the Bush adminis=\ntration,\" California Resources Secretary Mary Nichols said. \"A lot of pract=\nical, moderate people are recognizing climate change is a reality, not a th=\neory, and they need to take it into account and help move the direction of =\nthe world by doing something about it.\"=20\nCalifornia was an early leader in reducing dependence on fossil fuels that =\nrelease greenhouse gases. Today, 12% of its electrical power comes from ren=\newable sources, more than any other state.=20\nPresident Bush has sent mixed signals concerning global warming. Shortly af=\nter he took office, he reneged on a campaign promise to cut emissions of ca=\nrbon dioxide, the most abundant greenhouse gas. He said he rejected the int=\nernational accord, outlined in Kyoto, Japan, in 1997 and ratified last summ=\ner, because it would cost U.S. jobs and did not immediately impose limits o=\nn emissions from developing countries, including India and China.=20\nLast spring, Bush announced the formation of a task force of Cabinet member=\ns to formulate U.S. policy. The work of the task force was slowed by disagr=\neements among its members and by the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.=20\nIn the meantime, several members of Congress, including Sens. James M. Jeff=\nords (I-Vt.), John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.), have=\n begun formulating policy. McCain and Lieberman announced in August that th=\ney would develop legislation to cap greenhouse emissions and reduce them us=\ning a market-based trading mechanism. But that bill, too, has been delayed =\nas Congress grapples with the enormous fallout from the attacks on the Worl=\nd Trade Center and the Pentagon.=20\nMeanwhile, officials of several states say they are making measurable progr=\ness.=20\nIn New Jersey, officials say they are on track to cut greenhouse gases by 3=\n.5% below 1990 levels by 2005. The plan relies on capturing emissions from =\nmethane--which traps 20 times more heat than carbon dioxide--from landfills=\n, securing voluntary reductions from various industries and preserving open=\n space and trees, which can absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, said=\n Amy Collings, spokeswoman for the state Department of Environmental Protec=\ntion.=20\nNew York Gov. George Pataki in June announced a series of measures to impro=\nve energy efficiency and trim greenhouse gases. Specifically, the Republica=\nn governor ordered state buildings to get 20% of their electricity from ren=\newable sources, such as solar or wind power, by 2010.=20\nIn the Northwest, Seattle City Light, the local electric utility, will offs=\net any carbon dioxide emissions from power generation with wider use of cle=\nan-fueled vehicles and other measures.=20\nIn Oregon, more than 20,000 people have signed up for the \"Blue Sky Program=\n\" by paying an extra $3 per month on their utility bills to ensure that Pac=\nific Power and Light purchases electricity from sources that don't contribu=\nte to global warming, said Tim Honadel, sustainability coordinator for Gov.=\n John Kitzhaber.=20\nThe California Legislature has established a registry to track greenhouse g=\nas production. It gives businesses interested in reducing their emissions a=\n place to record their progress. Such progress will be rewarded when the st=\nate, as anticipated, begins to regulate greenhouse gas emissions.=20\nThere are growing indications that businesses, large and small, do want to =\ncooperate, if only to ensure that they have a hand in crafting policies and=\n regulations many see as inevitable.=20\nA group of Fortune 500 companies joined with the Philadelphia-based Pew Cha=\nritable Trusts to study and develop market-driven solutions to global warmi=\nng. Among the companies participating in the project are British Petroleum,=\n Boeing Co., Enron, Lockheed Martin Corp., Toyota Motor Corp. and Internati=\nonal Energy Corp.=20\nAt a carpet mill in Industry, where Interface Inc. employs 500 people, work=\ners are busy producing \"climate neutral\" carpet for commercial buildings, w=\nhich is made without generating greenhouse gases. The company recently inst=\nalled a $1-million solar array at its plant so it can make its product with=\nout any adverse impact on the Earth's atmosphere, said Jim Hartzfeld, vice =\npresident of sustainable strategies for the Atlanta-based corporation.=20\n\"This is about good business,\" Hartzfeld said. \"It's not about philanthropy=\n or altruism. It's about delivering better value.\"\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

At 23, Atta had a good job at Enron Corp. and lived =\nat one of Houston's trendy midtown addresses. He wrote of sporting events a=\nnd fireworks shows. His computer home page featured pictures of himself and=\n his pet and links to Internet sites devoted to the rock bands Jane's Addic=\ntion and Red Hot Chili Peppers.=20\nHe was, he said, living \"La Vida Houston.\"=20\nThat all changed after Sept. 11, when the Pakistani national was swept up i=\nn the government's ever-widening anti-terrorist dragnet.=20\nThough federal law-enforcement officials quickly concluded that Atta was no=\nt connected to the attacks in New York and near Washington, D.C., he was fo=\nund to have an expired visa and apparently was detained by the U.S. Immigra=\ntion and Naturalization Service.=20\nHis co-workers have not seen him since at least Sept. 12, an Enron official=\n said. His friends have not seen him either, and they are worried. His apar=\ntment appears vacant. His telephone and the message service at the door to =\nhis apartment building are disconnected. He did not tell Enron officials he=\n planned to leave.=20\n\"What on earth is going on?\" one of his close friends asked the Chronicle i=\nn response to an e-mail message.=20\nAtta's plight, similar to that of many Middle Eastern immigrants, has spark=\ned worries among some civil libertarians and congressional leaders. More th=\nan 500 people, many of them immigrants held for possible immigration violat=\nions, have been detained so far as possible suspects or material witnesses =\nas the government's investigation broadens almost daily.=20\nMany were questioned and detained because they had Arabic-sounding names. T=\nhe Washington Post reported on Sept. 19, for instance, that Atta was sought=\n for questioning because he had the same surname as one of the suspected hi=\njackers, Mohamed Atta.=20\nThe next day, the FBI said it \"has no interest in\" Asem Atta, but claimed t=\nhat he had overstayed his visa, said FBI spokesman Bob Doguim. An expired v=\nisa could lead to deportation. In Atta's case, that could mean being return=\ned to Pakistan, a country that is bracing for possible U.S. attacks on neig=\nhboring Afghanistan.=20\nCarl Rusnok, an INS spokesman, said he could not comment on individual INS =\ncases.=20\nCivil rights advocates acknowledge the need to question people to avert pos=\nsible terror strikes, but they fear law-enforcement officers may unjustly t=\narget some immigrants simply because they are foreigners.=20\n\"They're supposed to be looking for terrorists, but unfortunately they are =\npicking up a lot of people who haven't done anything wrong or are innocent =\nor of Middle Eastern descent,\" said Bruce Coane, an immigration attorney in=\n Houston and past president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association=\n.=20\nCoane said he fears that at least one of his clients, mistakenly hauled in =\nduring the sweep, had his civil rights violated.=20\nHe represents a Jordanian legal immigrant who was picked up by the INS on S=\nept. 21. More than a week later, the INS admitted the man had been apprehen=\nded and detained without reason and should be released, Coane said.=20\nCoane said he could not identify the man because INS proceedings are not pu=\nblic, but said his client had been convicted of two misdemeanors prior to r=\neceiving a green card, a document that allows noncitizens to remain in the =\nUnited States legally.=20\nINS can use criminal convictions as grounds for detaining immigrants, somet=\nimes indefinitely, or deporting them. But Coane said the INS knew about the=\n misdemeanors before issuing the man a green card.=20\nU.S. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Houston, ranking member on the House Subcom=\nmittee on Immigration and Claims, said that in the wake of the Sept. 11 att=\nacks, the government must give law enforcement powers to protect against po=\nssible terrorist assaults. But it also must safeguard civil liberties for i=\nmmigrants, she added.=20\n\"We want to . . . make sure that people are not brought in unfairly for que=\nstioning,\" she said.=20\nCongress is considering measures to broaden anti-terrorist police powers, s=\nuch as holding immigrants with possible links to terrorism longer between c=\nourt appearances.=20\nEdward Gillett, a Houston immigration attorney, said he does not fault the =\nINS for interviewing immigrants to find possible links to the hijackers or =\nimmigration violations. Had the hijackers' immigration status been reviewed=\n ahead of time, he said, the attacks may have been prevented. Several of th=\ne suicide hijackers had immigration violations that were not uncovered unti=\nl after the attacks.=20\n\"I wish they'd done this before it happened and maybe they could have preve=\nnted some of it,\" Gillett said.=20\nEfforts to reach Atta or determine his whereabouts last week were unsuccess=\nful.=20\nTypically, when a visa is expired, according to the INS, the agency can det=\nain the immigrant but must explain to him within 72 hours why he is being h=\neld and what charges he faces.=20\nSoon after that, the immigrant would probably be given a bond hearing to de=\ntermine if he should be detained while awaiting a hearing on his possible d=\neportation. The INS can hold immigrants indefinitely if they are deemed a f=\nlight risk or a danger to the community.=20\nThe deportation hearing may not take place for weeks or months, depending o=\nn the immigration judge's work load.=20\nTo stay in the country legally, Atta, or anyone in his situation, may be ab=\nle to obtain a sponsor - a relative or employer who is a U.S. citizen, for =\ninstance - or could marry a U.S. citizen. He may be able to return to his n=\native country to apply for another visa. If his visa has been expired for m=\nore than one year and he leaves the country, however, he will be barred fro=\nm returning for 10 years.=20\nIf the visa has expired for 180 days or more, and he leaves the country, he=\n won't be allowed to return for three years.=20\nAtta could also apply for political asylum.=20\nSahdi Shalabi, 24, one of Atta's closest friends from high school, said he =\nhad hoped to see Atta in the next few weeks. But now he is uncertain. He de=\nscribed his friend, whom he first met in Kuwait in 1990, as \"very playful, =\nvery easy going.\" He liked computers and talking to girls.=20\nShalabi said Atta attended an English-style high school in Kuwait and that =\nAtta's father worked for the Kuwait Oil Co. Atta moved to the United States=\n after graduating from high school, enrolled at Wichita State University ab=\nout 1994 and landed a job at Enron in Houston in 1999.=20\nAccording to his resume, Atta played indoor soccer at college and coached a=\n soccer team for young girls.=20\nShalabi, who works for Nortel Networks in Ontario, Canada, said his friend =\nwas Muslim but did not practice the religion.=20\n\"He's totally Westernized,\" he said.\n\n\n\nEnron Close to 5-Yr Contract With Equity Office, Crain's Says\n2001-10-07 18:31 (New York)\n\n\n     Chicago, Oct. 7 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. is close to\nwinning a five-year contract to supply power to Sam Zell's Equity\nOffice Properties Trust, Crain's Chicago reported, without citing\nsources.\n\n     Under the agreement, Houston-based Enron would deliver power\nto the Chicago-based property company's office buildings in\nChicago, Boston, California and New York, Crain's said.\n\n     Zell's company owns 30 buildings in the Chicago area, 55 in\nBoston, six in New York and 309 in California, Crain's said,\nciting a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\n\nBusiness/Financial Desk; Section C\nEnron Reaches a Deal to Sell Oregon Utility for $1.9 Billion\nBy ANDREW ROSS SORKIN\n\n10/06/2001\nThe New York Times\nPage 4, Column 5\nc. 2001 New York Times Company\n\nEnron is planning to announce on Monday that it has agreed to sell Portland=\n General Electric to another Oregon utility, Northwest Natural Gas, for abo=\nut $1.9 billion in cash and stock, executives close to the deal said yester=\nday.=20\nThe sale is part of Enron's effort to discard lower-margin utility business=\nes as it focuses on the more lucrative business of trading electricity and =\ngas.

The deal being discussed would be valued between $1.8 bi=\nllion and $2 billion, with as much as $1.5 billion in cash and the rest in =\nstock, a source familiar with the talks said Friday. In addition, Northwest=\n Natural Gas, based in Portland, Ore., would assume about $1.1 billion in d=\nebt. Also as part of the deal's terms, Enron could end up with a very small=\n stake in Northwest Natural Gas, the person said. The person described the =\ntalks as highly advanced and said a deal could be announced as soon as Mond=\nay. Northwest Natural Gas, in a brief statement Friday, confirmed it was ta=\nlking to Enron. Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne declined to comment. If a dea=\nl is announced, it would be the second time Enron struck an agreement to se=\nll Portland General. Nevada- based Sierra Pacific Resources agreed to buy P=\nortland General in November 1999. It was to pay $2.1 billion, including $2.=\n02 billion in cash. It also was to assume about $1 billion in debt and pref=\nerred stock. The deal was officially called off in April, although it had b=\neen considered dead for months before. Sierra Pacific planned to sell some =\nof its Nevada assets to raise cash for the deal, but Nevada's move to elect=\nricity deregulation was delayed, and Sierra couldn't carry out the sales. E=\nnergy trader Enron, which as part of a general strategy is shedding certain=\n assets, kept looking for a buyer. \"Enron needed some positive news, so thi=\ns should help the stock performance,\" Carol Coale, an analyst with Prudenti=\nal Securities in Houston. In a research note Friday, Robert Christensen, an=\n analyst with First Albany Corp. in New York, said benefits to Enron from a=\n sale include \"removal of a low single-digit earnings grower\" and balance s=\nheet improvement. Shares in Enron closed regular trading Friday at $31.73, =\ndown $1.37. Northwest Natural Gas provides natural gas to more than 500,000=\n residential and business customers throughout Oregon and Vancouver, Wash.,=\n while Portland General has more than 1.4 million customers in Oregon.\n\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

And its chairman,=\n Richard Reiten, is a former top executive at Portland General.=20\nFinancing would be the hitch. Northwest Natural Gas had a market capitaliza=\ntion of just $593 million as of Friday. Investors sent its stock down 9% on=\n the news of a possible acquisition to $23.62 by mid-afternoon Friday.=20\nEnron's wish price is reportedly $3 billion. But the Wall Street Journal, c=\niting sources, reported Friday that the number was $2.8 billion, $1.8 billi=\non in cash and stock plus debt assumption of another $1 billion. The articl=\ne also said Enron was considering taking a minority stake in the company, w=\nhich could explain the lower price.=20\nThe newspaper said the two were in \"advanced talks\" and an announcement cou=\nld come within days. Reuters, citing unnamed sources, reported that Northwe=\nst's board still had to vote on the deal but that it could be announced as =\nearly as Monday.=20\nEnron acquired Portland General in July 1997 for stock valued at $2.1 billi=\non in a deal hailed for combining power assets with natural gas pipelines. =\nBut it decided to dump the business after razor-slim margins and a very pub=\nlic clash with the Oregon Public Utilities Commission, which blocked its at=\ntempts to sell the utility's electricity generating assets, including its h=\nydroelectric facilities, and forced it to cut rates by $80 million.=20\nPortland General is not the only asset Enron is trying to shed.=20\nThe company is working furiously to dump $4 billion to $5 billion worth of =\nassets all around the world as it refocuses on \"asset-light\" businesses, su=\nch as trading and marketing.=20\nBut the effort hasn't gone well. It announced Oct. 3 it agreed to sell its =\nEnron Oil & Gas India Ltd. unit to BG Group plc of the U.K. for $388 millio=\nn. The unit owns a 30% interest in the Tapti gas field and the Panna/Mukta =\noil and gas fields and almost 63% of the CB-OS/1 exploration license in wes=\ntern India.=20\nIt now looks as if that deal could also come unstuck.

Northwest would pay about $1.5 billion in cash,\n$100 million in common stock and almost $300 million in preferred\nconvertible stock, the Times said. Enron spokesman Mark Palmer and\nJudith Wilkinson, spokeswoman for Northwest, declined to comment.\n\n     Enron bought Portland General in 1997 and has been trying to\nsell the utility for about two years, as it sheds slow-growing\nbusinesses to focus on trading of commodities such as electricity,\nnatural gas and lumber. A planned sale to Sierra Pacific Resources\ncollapsed about five months ago because of regulatory snags.\n\n     Trading doesn't require ownership of expensive assets such as\npower plants and pipelines, and Enron's profit from the business\nis growing at about 25 percent a year, analyst Robert Christensen\nof First Albany Corp. said. Portland General, while profitable, is\nexpected to boost earnings by just 1 percent next year, he said.\n\n     Houston-based Enron would retain about a 5 percent stake in\nPortland General, the Times said. Enron and Northwest officials\nplan to approve the deal today, the paper said. Northwest said\nyesterday the companies were in talks, confirming an earlier\nreport by the Wall Street Journal.\n\n                         Northwest Debt\n\n     Northwest, based in Portland, would assume about\n$1.1 billion in Portland General debt, the Times said. Northwest's\nshares fell $2.58, or 9.9 percent, yesterday to $23.41, cutting\nits market value to about $588 million.\n\n     The company already has about $450 million in debt, said bond-\nrating firm Egan Jones, which yesterday lowered its credit rating\non Northwest to ``A-'' from ``A,'' still investment grade.\n\n     Northwest serves more than half a million Oregon and\nWashington customers. Richard Reiten, the company's chairman and\nchief executive, was president of Portland General from 1989 to\n1996.\n\n     The acquisition would make Northwest a bigger gas purchaser,\nhelping it negotiate lower prices from suppliers, analysts said.\nThe company also might reduce costs through job cuts and\neliminating duplicate services.\n\n     Enron also is in talks to sell its 65 percent stake in the\nDabhol power project in India for more than $2.1 billion, the\nTimes said, citing the executives. A deal isn't imminent, the\npaper said.\n\n     Enron shares fell $1.37, or 4.1 percent, to $31.73 yesterday.\nThey have declined 62 percent this year, mostly because of the\nresignation of Chief Executive Jeff Skilling, concerns about the\nCalifornia power market, losses at its bandwidth-trading business\nand a contract dispute in India.\n\n     Sierra Pacific, based in Reno, Nevada, canceled its proposed\n$3.1 billion acquisition of Portland General on April 26 after\nCalifornia legislators, worried about a power shortage that had\ndriven up prices, banned sales of generators serving the state.\n\n     The move blocked Sierra Pacific from the sale of a power-\nplant stake needed to win clearance for the Portland General\npurchase.\n\n\nEDITORIAL\nPUC RIGHTLY OPEN TO RECONSIDERING\n\n10/06/2001\nPortland Oregonian\nSUNRISE\nE06\n(Copyright (c) The Oregonian 2001)\n\nWatching the rapidly cooling -- and now badly shocked -- economy, Oregon bu=\nsiness leaders and consumer advocates are understandably raising concerns a=\nbout the substantial utility rate hikes that went into effect this week.=20\nConsidering utility costs, the raises can be justified. But the fragile sta=\nte of the economy argues powerfully for openness to re- examine rates quick=\nly -- and the Public Utility Commission seems encouragingly open to doing t=\nhat.\nBoosts ranging from 20 percent for natural gas to 31.5 percent to 53 percen=\nt for electricity come at a time when users will have a tougher time absorb=\ning increases. The announcement that Northwest Natural Gas may acquire Port=\nland General Electric wouldn't have any impact on current rates. And adjust=\ning rates won't be a simple matter of pleading economic duress.=20\nThe PUC approved the rate hike, based on the utilities' increased costs and=\n their legal guarantee of a regulated profit. It turned down advocates' app=\neals for a postponement. But properly, it did agree to consider whether it =\nwould revisit rate cases.=20\nThat's an unusual step. But it's reasonable given the worsening economy and=\n surrounding uncertainty.=20\nNatural gas and electricity prices have fallen recently, below the forward =\ncontract prices paid by Northwest Natural and PGE. Normally, if utilities' =\ncosts go down, the drops are reflected in lower prices to users in the futu=\nre, or in rebates.=20\nIf the rate increases could be softened by being phased in, or reviewed mor=\ne frequently to take in lower costs, it could greatly help consumers and bu=\nsinesses.=20\nThe PUC has some flexibility and will decide by the end of the month on reo=\npening rate cases. Its openness to the idea is proper and prudent -- and ju=\nst a little encouraging.\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The 90- acre island, part o=\nf the Bimini Islands, is the site of an aragonite mine.\nBut under a proposal outlined this week to state and Broward County officia=\nls, the island would become an important offshore power supplier to Florida=\n. Liquified natural gas would arrive in tankers. A plant would convert it t=\no gaseous form and it would be sent to Port Everglades through a 70-mile un=\ndersea pipeline. The company also plans to build a 1,200-megawatt power pla=\nnt, with an undersea transmission line to South Florida.=20\n\"It's a good project to deliver energy into the state of Florida,\" said Don=\n Bartlett, vice president of AES Coral Inc., the company's Miami subsidiary=\n. \"It's a very economically doable project.\"=20\nWith its proposal, AES has emerged as a rival to Enron Corp. and El Paso Co=\nrp. in the race to build an undersea natural gas pipeline from the Bahamas =\nto the United States.=20\nAES Corp., based in Arlington, Va., is one of the biggest energy companies =\nin the world.

They need to look at the other uses -- =\nbeach renourishment, cables, treasure salvage leases, possible archaeologic=\nal sites.\"=20\nBartlett said the company would work with environmental officials to find a=\n route that minimizes environmental harm. The company plans to drill a rout=\ne under the reefs, using the technique of horizontal drilling, which should=\n leave the reefs undisturbed, he said.=20\n\"Our objective is to not have any environmental impact at all, and that's w=\nhat we're trying to achieve,\" he said.=20\nBy building a power plant offshore, AES would avoid the local opposition th=\nat doomed two power plant proposals in South Florida this year.=20\n\"The advantage to Broward County and the state of Florida is that 1,200 meg=\nawatts will come ashore without siting a power plant in Broward County,\" Ba=\nrtlett said. \"Siting plants in South Florida is pretty tough.\"=20\nIn addition to directly supplying electricity, the project would deliver na=\ntural gas to the region's power plants.=20\nDemand for natural gas has surged in the United States. The vast majority o=\nf new electric power plants use it for fuel because it generates far less p=\nollution than coal or oil.=20\nTwo power plants proposed for Deerfield Beach would both use natural gas, a=\nlthough one would use diesel oil as a backup fuel in case the natural gas s=\nupply was interrupted.=20\nBut the AES proposal faces competition from two Houston energy companies. E=\nl Paso Corp. has proposed a natural gas pipeline from Grand Bahama Island t=\no a point near the Port of Palm Beach, where it would hook up with the stat=\ne's gas transmission system. Enron Corp. has filed applications for permits=\n to construct a pipeline from Grand Bahama to Port Everglades.=20\nThe decision on who gets to build the pipeline could ultimately be up to th=\ne Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which governs the distribution of n=\natural gas throughout the country. Enron has moved the furthest in the appr=\noval process, having filed applications with the commission, the state Depa=\nrtment of Environmental Protection and other agencies.=20\nIt is unclear whether all three pipeline projects could go forward, since t=\nhey would be seeking to sell natural gas to many of the same customers. Enr=\non spokesman John Ambler said the state's demand for energy could support m=\nore than one new source of supply.=20\n\"I think it's clear that Florida needs more gas,\" he said. \"A diversity of =\nsources of supply is probably a good thing. I don't know if we need all of =\nthe proposals that are being speculated about. But the demand projection ov=\ner the next 10 years is that Florida is going to need another 12,000 megawa=\ntts of power, and that means a lot of gas is going to be needed.\"\n\nMAP; Caption: Staff graphic Map: Locates Ocean Cay in Bimini Islands.=20\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Enron last week paid the first $500,000 of the fees, but they hav=\ne asked for a different payment schedule, Capellini said.=20\nEnron officials want to be able to burn diesel fuel as a backup power sourc=\ne because currently, only one natural gas pipeline operates in Florida. But=\n two other pipelines -- one coming across the Gulf of Mexico and the other =\ncoming from the Bahamas -- are in the works.=20\nEnron might be willing to drop their plans for diesel fuel, but only if \"on=\ne or both\" of those pipelines works by the time they build their plant, sai=\nd Eric Thode, a company spokesman.=20\n\"Functionally, the plant is an ambulance service,\" Thode said. \"It has to b=\ne able to be used at a moment's notice.\"=20\nIf Capellini were to convince Enron Corp. to drop the diesel fuel portion o=\nf their plans, it would represent a political victory for him and his city.=\n That's because the mayor of Coral Springs, one of the cities that has chal=\nlenged the state's intention to give Enron an air-quality permit, has said =\nthat he will back off if they drop their plans to burn diesel fuel.=20\nSo far, Coral Springs has declined to take as aggressive a stance as neighb=\noring Coconut Creek, where government attorneys sued Deerfield Beach on Jul=\ny 13. Coconut Creek attorneys argue that a conflict in zoning laws made it =\nillegal for Deerfield Beach city officials to approve the Enron plant the w=\nay they did.=20\nBroward Circuit Judge Leonard Stafford dismissed the lawsuit last month bec=\nause he said Coconut Creek had not followed proper procedure, but allowed t=\nhe city to change the suit and file again. Last week, they did just that, s=\naid Mitch Bernstein, an attorney for Coconut Creek.=20\n\"The claims are essentially the same, but they are more thoroughly supporte=\nd by the events that took place in Deerfield Beach when they considered Enr=\non's application,\" Bernstein said.=20\nCapellini said Tuesday evening there were numerous parts of Coconut Creek's=\n lawsuit that are inaccurate.=20\nJeremy Milarsky can be reached at jmilarsky@sun-sentinel.com or call 954-57=\n2-2020.\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Dyer\n\n10/06/2001\nKRTBN Knight-Ridder Tribune Business News: Fort Worth Star-Telegram - Texas\nCopyright (C) 2001 KRTBN Knight Ridder Tribune Business News; Source: World=\n Reporter (TM)\n\nAUSTIN, Texas--An offshoot company of Houston-based Enron led the state in =\n\"slamming\" complaints on allegations of attempting to sign up electric cust=\nomers without their consent, state records show.=20\nThe Texas Public Utility Commission has received at least 14 complaints aga=\ninst the Enron-created NewPower Co. and one each against providers Green Mo=\nuntain, Reliant, First Choice and Shell, according to documents filed with =\nstate regulators.\nThe Texas electric deregulation law prohibits the practice and sets penalti=\nes of up to $5,000 per day, per customer, but the PUC has taken no official=\n enforcement action against any of the companies.=20\n\"Slamming\" is slang for changing customers' utility providers without their=\n permission.=20\nA NewPower spokeswoman said the company is aware of the complaints and has =\nbegun an investigation.=20\n\"NewPower has a zero tolerance policy towards slamming,\" said company spoke=\nswoman Terri Cohen. \"We have more than 50,000 Texans who have chosen to swi=\ntch to NewPower. Even a fraction of a percent of slamming complaints -- whi=\nch is what this is -- is not acceptable to us.\"=20\nUnder the state's new deregulation law, companies such as NewPower can offe=\nr lower prices and different service plans to lure customers away from the =\nstate's utility companies.=20\nA pilot project that began this year allows companies to compete for up to =\n5 percent of customers. Most of the Texas market will open Jan. 1.=20\nThe process is overseen by the PUC and a nonprofit corporation that manages=\n the state's electric power grid.=20\nUnder the Texas Open Records Act, the Star-Telegram obtained information on=\n 68 complaints about the pilot project filed between March 1 and Sept. 27. =\nOther complaints involved billing, customer frustrations over delays in the=\n pilot project, customer service and deceptive trade practices.=20\nJames Pittman, 52, of Houston, said he switched to NewPower after a telepho=\nne marketer told him he would have to choose a new electric company -- or t=\nhe state would choose one for him.=20\nPittman said the telemarketer incorrectly told him he would have to pay fee=\ns for a forced switch but could switch to NewPower for no charge.=20\n\"I just flat out told her that I just got out of the hospital from a heart =\nattack, and I didn't feel like I was up to any of this,\" Pittman said.=20\n\"She told me that I had to change (electric service), or the state would ch=\nange it for me. She said it wouldn't be our choice. It would be whatever th=\ne state decided.\"=20\nPittman said he then had difficulty switching back to Reliant.=20\nSeveral Texas residents, including some TXU customers in North Texas, also =\nreported receiving switch notifications even though they had not requested =\nnew service.=20\nPUC spokesman Terry Hadley said some of the slamming complaints may have be=\nen prompted by computer glitches at the power grid. Others may have been ca=\nused by confusion by marketers and the public over the new deregulation law=\n.=20\nHadley said regulators will continue to monitor complaints, although it is =\npremature for the PUC to take enforcement actions.=20\n\"It's early in the game and we would expect that as education increases, we=\n might not see the so-called complaints in the future,\" Hadley said.=20\nHe said lawmakers had inserted strong anti-slamming language into the dereg=\nulation law after witnessing similar problems with the deregulation of long=\n-distance telephone service. The PUC received 5,700 such complaints in one =\nyear alone, he said.=20\nBut Reggie James, director of the Austin office of the Consumers Union, sai=\nd the PUC should have done a better job of educating consumers about their =\nrights under the new law.=20\nHe said a $12 million customer-education campaign by the PUC has focused fo=\nr the most part on \"happy talk\" to defend deregulation.=20\n\"If deregulation is going to work, it will require the confidence of all co=\nnsumers,\" said James. \"And if people think they're going to get ripped off =\nby the companies that are competing, it will hurt all the competitors.\"=20\nComplaints about slamming and other problems can be lodged with the PUC by =\ncalling (888) 782-8477.\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

It is a response to their intent NOT a suggestion.\n \nThis is not Enron's TRADING view.. we do not think there will be shut-ins the near term because:\n \nThe producers are looking to shut in at $1.75 levels.. this would have to occur for several months.. cash is currently at this level but contangos are at all time highs..Nov01 is 42 cents above this level, Dec01 is 83 cents above this level. CY02..$1.05 and CY03 $1.525!!!\n \nso.. no one is shutting in now.  as soon as we hear of anyone doing so, we will let you know..\n \nSo from a trading perspective we still advocate being short Nov, Dec, and 1st 6 months of CY02..\n \nPlease call me with questions.. I am in Houston this week (713-853-4759) and can set up discussions with John Arnold, Julie Gomez (our fundy specialist) or Jim Schweiger our Texas storage operator.\n \nComing...

Emshwiller\nStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal\n\n10/24/2001\nThe Wall Street Journal\nA2\n(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)\n\nEnron Corp. might have to come up with several hundred million dollars or more during the next 20 months to cover potential shortfalls in investment vehicles it created. Covering such shortfalls could involve issuing additional Enron shares, diluting the position of current shareholders. \nHowever, Enron Treasurer Ben Glisan said in an interview yesterday that the company believes it can repay about $3.3 billion in notes that were sold by those investment vehicles without having to resort to issuing more stock. The notes were sold to investors during recent years by several entities -- known as the Marlin Water Trust II, the Marlin Water Capital Corp. II, the Osprey Trust and Osprey I, Inc. The notes are coming due during the next 20 months.\nMr. Glisan said assets from the entities could be sold to pay off some of the notes. Also, Enron is selling other assets. Proceeds from those transactions also could go toward repaying the notes, which ultimately are guaranteed by Enron. \nHe said it appears that asset sales will raise at least $2.2 billion by the end of next year. This amount includes cash proceeds of $1.55 billion from the previously announced sale of Enron's Portland General Electric utility unit. Enron hopes to complete that sale by the end of 2002. \n\"There are a number of other assets we believe will raise sufficient proceeds\" to repay the notes, Mr. Glisan said. \"But if we are wrong, we will issue equity.\" Mr. Glisan said a worst-case scenario would involve issuing as much as $1 billion in stock. Enron said it has about 850 million shares outstanding. \nMaking up any shortfall with equity has become more expensive because of the drop in Enron's share price. In 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron shares were down 86 cents to $19.79. The stock was once again one of the most actively traded with about 27 million shares changing hands. Early this year, Enron stock was more than $80 a share. \nDuring the past week, shares of the energy-trading giant have dropped more than 40%. Early last week, Enron reported a $618 million third-quarter loss, resulting from $1.01 billion in write-offs. The company also disclosed a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity for the quarter as a result of terminating certain transactions related to a partnership that for a time was headed by Enron Chief Financial Officer Andrew S. Fastow. In July, Mr. Fastow ended his connection to the partnership in the face of growing concerns by analysts and major investors. On Monday, Enron disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commission was looking into the transactions related to Mr. Fastow. Enron has said its dealings with the partnership were proper. \nThe turmoil of the past several days prompted Enron to schedule a conference call yesterday morning with Wall Street analysts and others in an effort to reassure investors. Enron Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay said while \"we are extremely disappointed with our stock price . . . our businesses are performing very well.\" Mr. Lay and other executives said Enron has adequate liquidity to meet its needs. \nMr. Fastow, the chief financial officer, took part in the conference call. But neither he nor Mr. Lay would answer any questions concerning the Fastow-related partnership, which was known as LJM2 Co-Investment LP. Mr. Lay said the SEC was in the midst of an inquiry concerning that partnership arrangement, which has raised conflict-of-interest questions among analysts and others. Mr. Lay cited shareholder suits filed recently as another reason not to discuss the partnership questions. Mr. Lay said he was \"very concerned about the way Andy's character has been loosely tossed about.\" He added \"we continue to have the highest faith and confidence in Andy.\" \nInternal LJM2 documents indicate that Mr. Fastow and perhaps a handful of fellow Enron officials made millions of dollars in management fees and capital increases from running the partnership. Billions of dollars of Enron assets and stock were involved in LJM2-related transactions, according to Enron SEC filings. \nDuring the conference call, analysts -- even some who have been longtime Enron fans -- challenged executives about the Fastow partnership arrangement and the company's often opaque financial reports. \"There's the appearance you are hiding something,\" said Goldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer. \"You need to do everything in your power to demonstrate to investors that your dealings are above board.\" \nMr. Lay responded, \"We're trying to be as transparent as we can.\"\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Lay, strongly defended the company's chief financial officer and said there was no conflict of interest involved in transactions that the Securities and Exchange Commission was looking into.\nBut he refused to go into detail on the transaction that Enron made with partnerships run by Andrew S. Fastow, the chief financial officer. In addition, Mr. Fastow, while declaring that Enron ''expects to continue to have sufficient liquidity to meet normal obligations,'' declined to answer any questions about it. \nThe conference call, which began just as trading opened on the New York Stock Exchange, at first seemed to be reassuring investors. Within minutes of the beginning of the call, the share price rallied to $23.25. But it soon began falling, and ended the day down 86 cents, at $19.79. The day's low of $19.62 was the lowest since Jan. 12, 1998, and was down 78 percent from the high set by the stock in the summer of 2000. \nUntil recently, most investors focused on the company's reported operating earnings, which showed good results as it became a leading player in energy markets. But the focus has shifted to a series of transactions, some involving off-balance-sheet financing. One, involving partnerships controlled by Mr. Fastow, led to a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity that raised concern last week and led to S.E.C. inquiries that the company disclosed on Monday. \nOne of the company's strongest supporters has been David Fleischer, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs. But he told Mr. Lay on the call yesterday that Enron had to be more forthcoming with information. ''There is an appearance that you are hiding something,'' he said. \nAfter the call, Mr. Fleischer expressed disappointment. ''They've engaged in a number of transactions that one wonders about, and that are hard to understand,'' he said in an interview. ''They have not been as forthcoming in explaining them'' as is needed, he said. But he said he was still recommending the stock. ''I don't think accountants and auditors would have allowed total shenanigans,'' he said. ''In the absence of total shenanigans going on at this company, there is tremendous value here.'' \nMr. Lay cited the S.E.C. inquiries as a reason for not discussing details on the transactions involving the partnerships that were controlled by Mr. Fastow. But he emphasized that both he and the company's board ''continue to have the highest faith and confidence in Andy.'' \nMr. Lay said that auditors from Arthur Andersen had carefully reviewed Enron's reporting in conjunction with another off-balance-sheet vehicle, called Marlin. That company owns one-third of Azurix, an Enron subsidiary that owns Wessex, a British water utility. The auditors ''have determined there is no write-down required,'' he said under questioning by Richard Grubman of Highfields Capital Management, a money management firm. \nMr. Grubman said that Marlin owed almost $1 billion on debt that was guaranteed by Enron but had no assets other than the Azurix stake. Noting that Enron had paid about $300 million to buy a third of Azurix from public shareholders and had since taken write-downs on its investment in Azurix, Mr. Grubman asked why the company was not setting up reserves to cover its exposure on that debt, which under a complicated arrangement could end up being satisfied through the issuance of Enron shares. \nMr. Lay said that no action was needed but declined to address details. Eventually he cut off Mr. Grubman. ''I know you're trying to drive the stock price down, and you've done a pretty good job of it,'' Mr. Lay said. ''But let's move on to the next question.'' \nMr. Fastow said the company was having no problem issuing commercial paper and had $1.85 billion in such debt outstanding. He said it was backed by $3.35 billion in bank lines of credit, of which $1.75 billion will expire next May if it is not renewed. \nMr. Lay said he was sorry about ''the misunderstanding'' that resulted when his brief mention of the $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity in a conference call last week was not noticed by some analysts. That reduction would have been apparent if the company had released its balance sheet with the earnings report, but it did not. He said the company would consider releasing balance sheets with earnings reports in the future, but made no promises. \nThe large reduction in shareholder equity did not affect reported earnings, and so was not in the earnings release. But it raised concerns that some of the sophisticated financing techniques used by the company might be effectively keeping losses off the earnings statement. The S.E.C. is expected to look into whether the accounting for that transaction was correct. \nAfter one questioner on the call said it would be easier to understand Enron if it released financial statements for the special purpose vehicles that were set up to enter into such transactions as Marlin, Mr. Lay said the company ''will look into providing'' such statements.\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Contrarians believe the CBOE equity put/call ratio sends a bearish signal when it is below 0.40. By the session's end, the ratio was at 0.49. \nBuyers drove robust call trading in Cisco Systems, a maker of Internet switching equipment, and the implied volatility also rose, noted a trader at Letco, the CBOE specialist for Cisco options. One investor bought thousands of January 20 calls, paying about $115 a contract for the right to buy 100 shares of the stock at $20 a share until mid-January. At 4 p.m. in Nasdaq Stock Market trading, Cisco was down 42 cents at $16.41. The January 20 calls fell 10 cents to 90 cents on CBOE volume of 27,048 contracts, while 6,861 contracts traded at the Pacific Exchange. \nThe implied volatility of Enron's near-month options remains high, even as the energy concern's executives sought to calm investors and address their concerns, following news that the Securities and Exchange Commission is looking at the Houston company. \nThe volatility spike makes Enron a viable candidate for investors looking to sell straddles -- selling calls and puts with the same strike price and expiration. In particular, Enron's at-the-money January 20 straddles offer rich premiums, said Lillian Seidman of the Seidman/Skupp options team at Miller Tabak & Co., of New York. With Enron down 86 cents at $19.79 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, selling January 20 straddles would earn an investor about $750 a straddle -- a rich premium that could offset the cost of buying stock. \nTo be sure, selling straddles can be risky and the losses significant if the stock, which already had fallen about 38% in a week, makes a big move in either direction before the straddles expire.

Tuesday it dropped another 86 cents to close at $19.79. \nThe news brought to the forefront ongoing complaints from some on Wall Street that some of Enron's financial mechanisms are difficult to understand and that Enron doesn't provide detailed enough financial data about its performance. \nTuesday morning, Enron Chairman and CEO Ken Lay held a conference call for investors and analysts, aimed at addressing their concerns. \nIt remains to be seen whether he succeeded, but based on the tenor of questions during the call, it's doubtful he achieved that result. \nDavid Fleischer, a Goldman Sachs analyst, told Lay that the company's credibility was being severely questioned and called on him to do everything in his power to explain to investors that Enron's dealings are aboveboard. \n\"I, for one, find the disclosure is not complete enough for me to understand and explain all the intricacies of all those transactions,\" he said. \nLay told callers he was limited in speaking about the LJM partnerships because of the SEC inquiry. \nHe did say Enron was aware an \"inherent conflict of interest\" would result from its chief financial officer running investment partnerships doing business with Enron. \nIn response, Enron set up procedures, which Lay said were rigorously followed, to ensure shareholder interests wouldn't be compromised. \n\"There was a Chinese Wall between LJM and Enron,\" he said, adding that Enron wasn't obligated to do deals with the LJM entities and did so when it was in Enron's best interest. \nLay and Enron's board continue to have the \"highest faith and confidence\" in Fastow, he added. \nFastow resigned his roles with the LJM entities in June after criticism from Wall Street. \nEnron ended its financial relationships with the partnerships. \nIt took a $35 million charge in the third quarter and reduced shareholders' equity by $1.2 billion as a result. \nDuring the call Enron executives also addressed other issues. \nThey stressed that Enron expects to continue having sufficient liquidity to carry out normal operations and took questions about two financing vehicles, Whitewing and the Atlantic Water Trust, that it set up so it could invest in certain assets without issuing debt or Enron shares at the time of the investments. \nIf Enron should lose its current investment-grade quality debt rating, commitments made as part of those financing vehicles could trigger steps that would cause the value of Enron's current outstanding shares to become diluted. \nJeff Dietert, an analyst with Simmons & Co. International in Houston who follows Enron, was among those on the call. He said afterward he received some new information about Enron's lines of credit. \n\"I had hoped to get a little bit more out of the call,\" he said. \n\n\nOBSERVER - Busy signal.\n\n10/24/2001\nFinancial Times (U.K. edition)\n(c) 2001 Financial Times Limited .

A live webcast of the call was accessible on Enron's website, but without the chance to grill Enron brass. \nThose investors and journalists who did make it through (some waited 20 minutes for their place at the party; others found their lines dropped mid-stream) heard volatile exchanges between analysts and company executives. An analyst chided for his part in lowering the company's share price was told by Ken Lay, Enron's chairman, that his question quota was up and it was time to move on. \n(c) Copyright Financial Times Ltd.

Treasurer Ben Glisan said the company thinks it can repay about $3.3 billion in notes sold by investment vehicles it created without having to issue more stock, the Wall Street Journal reported in its online edition on Wednesday. \nEnron may need to come up with funds to cover potential shortfalls in those investment vehicles, which could involve issuing additional shares, thereby diluting the position of current shareholders, the report said.\nThe report, which cites a Tuesday interview with Glisan, said the notes were sold to investors during recent years by several entities and are coming due during the next 20 months. The entities are known as the Marlin Water Trust II, the Marlin Water Capital Corp. II, the Osprey Trust and Osprey I Inc, the report said. \nAccording to the report, Glisan said assets from those entities could be sold to pay off some of the notes. Enron is selling other assets, the report said. According to the newspaper, proceeds from those sales could go toward repaying the notes, which are ultimately guaranteed by Enron. \nGlisan, according to the report, said it looks like asset sales will raise at least $2.2 billion by the end of 2002. \n\"There are a number of other assets we believe will raise sufficient proceeds\" to repay the notes, Glisan said, according to the report. \"But if we are wrong, we will issue equity.\" \nAccording to the report, Glisan said a worst-case scenario would involve issuing as much as $1 billion in stock. \nEnron held a conference call on Tuesday, seeking to assuage investor concerns after U.S. regulators said they were looking into transactions involving the company's chief financial officer and its stock shed more than $10 billion in value over the past week. \nEnron said on the call it can tap $3.35 billion from a credit line, suggesting it has enough liquidity to operate its core trading and marketing business, which can experience wide swings in cash flow, depending on commodity prices and market hedges.\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The notes were sold to investors during recent years by several entities -- known as the Marlin Water Trust II, the Marlin Water Capital Corp. II, the Osprey Trust and Osprey I, Inc. The notes are coming due during the next 20 months. \nMr. Glisan said assets from the entities could be sold to pay off some of the notes. Also, Enron is selling other assets. Proceeds from those transactions also could go toward repaying the notes, which ultimately are guaranteed by Enron. \nHe said it appears that asset sales will raise at least $2.2 billion by the end of next year. This amount includes cash proceeds of $1.55 billion from the previously announced sale of Enron's Portland General Electric utility unit. Enron hopes to complete that sale by the end of 2002. \n\"There are a number of other assets we believe will raise sufficient proceeds\" to repay the notes, Mr. Glisan said. \"But if we are wrong, we will issue equity.\" Mr. Glisan said a worst-case scenario would involve issuing as much as $1 billion in stock. Enron said it has about 850 million shares outstanding. \nMaking up any shortfall with equity has become more expensive because of the drop in Enron's share price. In 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron shares were down 86 cents to $19.79. The stock was once again one of the most actively traded with about 27 million shares changing hands.

Shares of Bristol-Myers Squibb, for example, gave up 1.68, or 2.8%, to 58.02, American Home Products lost 1.40, or 2.3%, to 58.90, and Schering-Plough eased 74 cents, or 1.9%, to 38.17. \nShares of several insurance and reinsurance providers also pulled back in reaction to profit statements, with Everest Re falling 6.40, or 8.4%, to 69.50, and St. Paul dropping 93 cents, or 1.9%, to 49.25. \nPower utility Exelon, Chicago, was set back 3.42, or 7.7%, to 41.08, after its third-quarter results topped forecasts, but drew critical comments from several analysts. \nNevertheless, even with the grim earnings outlook, investors showed continued reluctance to throw in the towel. \n\"Institutional investors are busy trying to gauge the sentiment in the market,\" Richard Cripps, market strategist at Legg Mason, said. \"Their fear is that the market makes a four or five percent upside run very quickly, which is eminently possible, and they can't afford to miss it.\" \nSome seasonal factors also have played a role in supporting stock prices recently. For many mutual funds, for example, their fiscal year concludes at the end of October. Some are doing what is called window dressing -- buying stocks that their investment disciplines say should be in their portfolio -- while others need to boost their overall exposure to the equities market. \nWhatever the reason, the market has been making some big moves when prices have risen, and modest moves when they have declined. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which ran up 172.92 points Monday, declined 36.95 points yesterday, a loss of 0.39%, to 9340.08. \nThe Nasdaq Composite Index declined 3.64 points, or 0.21%, to 1704.44. Volume levels showed some improvement over Monday's rather sluggish pace. \nInvestors haven't completely rolled over. In a handful of the situations in which their ire has been raised, they have lashed those stocks repeatedly. Shares of SBC Communications, one of Monday's disappointments, got punished again, falling 2.62, or 6.3%, to 38.78, and fell back in range of a 52-week low of 38.20, set June 26. \nConsumer lender Providian Financial got sent to a fresh 52-week low, off 41 cents, or 8.3%, to 4.55. Enron, which has fallen on concerns about conflicts of interest in dealings among the company, a power marketer, and partnerships that were set up and run by its chief financial officer, dropped an additional 86 cents, or 4.2%, to 19.79, hitting a 52-week low intraday. \nThere were some winning profit statements. Shares of CSX, for example, rose 2.45, or 7.5%, to 35.19, after the Richmond, Va., rail-freight concern reported third-quarter earnings that, while they fell short of year-ago performance, nevertheless managed to top Wall Street's forecasts. \nVitesse Semiconductor (Nasdaq), a Camarillo, Calif., maker of integrated circuits used in high-bandwidth communications networks, added 43 cents, or 4.5%, to 9.99, even though the company's losses for its fiscal fourth quarter proved sharper than expected. \nNetIQ (Nasdaq) dropped 4.23, or 14%, to 26.17, even though the Santa Clara, Calif., developer of networking software posted fiscal first-quarter results late Monday that topped what analysts had been looking for. \nChartered Semiconductor (Nasdaq) advanced 40 cents, or 2.1%, to 19.10. The Singapore chip foundry reported third-quarter results that showed a loss for the period, but nevertheless proved to be a little more encouraging than analysts had projected. \nShares of several cable-television operators moved higher. Charter Communications added 59 cents, or 4.5%, to 13.62, Comcast gained 40 cents, or 1.1%, to 36.82, and Cox Communications rose 44 cents, or 1.1%, to 40.15. Thomas Weisel Partners said that cable operators should benefit from SBC Communications' decision, revealed Monday with its quarterly results, to scale back the growth of its digital subscriber line service offering. \nEarthLink (Nasdaq) slid 2.51, or 14%, to 14.85. The Atlanta Internet service provider issued stronger-than-expected third-quarter results, but also signaled that its customer growth had slowed. \nAT&T Wireless increased 1.26, or 9.7%, to 14.20. The Redmond, Wash., provider of wireless communications services reported third-quarter results that topped what analysts had been looking for. \nSeveral steelmakers moved higher following a ruling late Monday by the U.S. Trade Commission, which said it determined that domestic steelmakers have been significantly harmed by cheap imports; the ruling could lead to the erection of barriers limiting steel imports. USX-U.S. Steel Group gained 28 cents, or 1.9%, to 15.02, Nucor rose 1.05, or 2.5%, to 42.87, and AK Steel improved 41 cents, or 4.6%, to 9.31. \nMcKesson advanced 1.56, or 4.2%, to 38.95. The San Francisco drug distributor and health-care information technology provider posted stronger-than-expected fiscal second-quarter results. \nWatson Pharmaceuticals fell 3.05, or 6%, to 48.11. UBS Warburg reduced its rating on the Corona, Calif., drug maker, and lowered its earnings projections for the company. \nFurniture Brands dropped 2.04, or 8.9%, to 20.96. UBS Warburg cut its rating on the St. Louis furniture manufacturer, saying it believes the company has lost market share to rival manufacturers.\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Bergesen has three new LNG ships on order, two of which have already been contracted out to Belgian gas distributor Distrigas. \nSTOP AND THINK \nThe world's largest and only pure LNG shipping player, Golar LNG, historically bullish in its outlook, has also been forced to stop and consider the problem. \nGolar has six ships locked into long-term contracts, but four more are under construction at South Korea's Daewoo and Hyundai yards and do not yet have firm future employment. \n\"There is a reasonable balance between the production coming onstream and the amount of ships ordered,\" Golar Executive VP Sveinung Stohle told Reuters, \"The only risk is things might be delayed.\" \nStohle said that contracting out the new ships remained an option, but it was also developing an LNG trading arm, which might have a use for some of them. \nGolar's closest competitor in terms of size, Exmar, is taking a more traditional approach. It has six ships on order and said it would leave as little as possible to chance. \n\"We've chartered out all of them except the Samsung ship, which is under offer for the (Qatari) RasGas tender,\" Managing Director Nicolas Saverys told Reuters. Four are booked out to El Paso and one to Enron. \nHe said that until all the upcoming projects had their Supply Production Agreements in place, it would be too risky for companies to place fresh ship orders. \n\"It's a good time to wait,\" said Saverys.\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - General Motors, IBM and Kmart are among corporations that would receive billions of dollars in tax refunds under a $100 billion House Republican economic stimulus package. Democrats say it is far too generous to companies and does too little for individuals. \nSeven companies would get a total of $3.3 billion in refunds of alternative minimum taxes they paid as far back as 1986. The tax, which the House legislation also would repeal outright, is intended to ensure a basic minimum income tax is paid by companies and individuals that claim numerous deductions and credits.\nIBM would get a $1.4 billion refund, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, while GM would get $832 million, Kmart $102 million and General Electric $671 million. Others specified for big refunds include energy giant Enron, at $254 million; U.S. Steel, $39 million; and grocery chain Kroger, $9 million. \nIn addition, the study found that Ford Motor Co. would get a refund that could total $2.3 billion, while Chevron's could reach $314 million. \nCounting repeal of the tax, corporations would get more than $25 billion in tax relief from these minimum tax provisions in 2002 alone. In addition, the bill would make permanent a temporary tax break for financial services firms doing a lot of overseas business, providing them $21 billion in tax relief over 10 years. \nThe generous corporate tax breaks are among the most contentious items in the House GOP measure, scheduled for a floor vote Wednesday. Democrats say the measure is certain to change once it reaches the Senate; the Bush administration also has signaled that $100 billion is too costly. \n\"It's clear the House bill cannot pass the Senate as it is,\" said Sen. John Breaux, D-La. \nFor individuals, the House legislation includes a new round of tax rebate checks for workers who didn't get them this summer and a cut in the current 27 percent income tax rate to 25 percent in 2002, four years earlier than under the just-enacted tax cut. The measure also reduces capital gains rates from 20 percent to 18 percent for most taxpayers, enhances business equipment write-offs and allows companies to deduct current losses against taxes paid five years earlier. \nThe primary sponsor, Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Thomas, said in a newspaper opinion piece published Tuesday in USA Today that the legislation \"is a shot of adrenaline\" that will help restart the economy while not triggering inflation. \n\"Businesses generate jobs, and jobs are the core of a strong economy,\" wrote Thomas, R-Calif. \nWhile bipartisan support backs some of the House items, Senate Democrats have been pushing for expanded unemployment benefits and help for workers who lose health insurance. Sen. Max Baucus, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, presented a $70 billion proposal Tuesday that would extend unemployment benefits by 13 weeks, provide a 50 percent federal match for COBRA health insurance policies and allow more workers to qualify for Medicaid. \nThe legislation also includes rebate checks and some business items similar to the House bill but not the capital gains reduction or the alternative minimum tax relief. Tax cuts in the Baucus measure would total $35 billion in 2002, far below the House GOP level. \n\"This proposal appropriately responds to the sign of the times, helping this nation get back to work and recover quickly,\" said Baucus, D-Mont. \nOther Democrats were working on spending programs. Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., said he was putting together a $20 billion package that included hiring extra customs and border agents and food inspectors, augmented security at nuclear plants and purchase of more vaccines. \nSen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said President Bush does not want the stimulus bill laden with additional spending. \n\"Everything in this package needs to be stimulative,\" Grassley said. \"There needs to be more done on the investment side.\" \n--- \nOn the Net: House members: http://www.house.gov/house/MemberWWW.html\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

So and I`m only investing a little bit every month in it but you think that`s pretty wise idea just kind of keep on doing small investments? \nLUSKIN: Well as a general investing strategy yes but Enron is a special case where we have a company that`s in bad trouble. We had a CEO who basically left without explanation a couple of months ago, then yesterday the CFO has been accused of some pretty strange looking self dealing issues. We don`t know how that`s going to resolve but this is a company under a cloud so you might want to hold off on your buying program until that cloud lifts a little bit. \nFRANCIS: All right Don, thank you very much; we appreciate it. Don Luskin. \nLUSKIN: All right. \n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. \t\n\n"

The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.

As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.

For Enron, the move comes about five years after it bought Portland General as part of a plan to break into the nation's deregulating power markets. Since then, Enron has backed away from that strategy, in part because of the California energy crisis. Enron agreed to sell the utility to Sierra Pacific Resources, of Reno, Nev., for about $2 billion in 1999, but that transaction fell apart this year.\nMeanwhile, little-known Northwest Natural, of Portland, Ore., is betting that buying Portland General's operations will give it more muscle on its home turf. The combined company, with $5 billion in assets, will have more than 1.25 million electric and gas customers and will own more than 2,000 megawatts of generation, 26,000 miles of electric transmission and distribution lines, as well as 12,000 miles of gas lines. Northwest Natural supplies natural gas to more than 500,000 residential and business customers in Oregon and Vancouver, Wash. Portland General is an electric utility serving more than 1.4 million customers in Oregon. \nTerms of the transaction call for Enron to receive $1.55 billion in cash, $200 million in Northwest Natural preferred stock, and $50 million in Northwest Natural common stock. Enron has agreed to hold the securities for at least 2 1/2 years. The common equity stake will give Enron voting rights amounting to 4.9% of the total number of Northwest Natural shares outstanding. Enron, a Houston energy-trading concern, also will receive as many as two seats on Northwest Natural's board, which has 12 members and the authority to boost that number to 13. It isn't clear if Enron would seek two seats. \n\"This sale is consistent with our overall objective of selling assets that are not strategic to our wholesale and retail energy business,\" said Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's chairman and chief executive. \nThe cash portion of the transaction will be raised through loans arranged by Merrill Lynch & Co. , of New York, and Credit Suisse First Boston, a unit of Switzerland's Credit Suisse Group. Enron was advised by Credit Suisse First Boston, and Northwest Natural's financial adviser was Merrill Lynch.\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

All Rights Reserved\n\nEnron, the US energy giant, has agreed to sell electricity utility Portland General Electric to Northwest Natural Gas for $1.88bn. NW Natural, a regional utility, will also assume about $1.1bn in PG debt and preferred stock. Enron had been seeking to dispose of the utility for some time because it is no longer core. It is also attempting to dispose of up to $5bn in other assets - primarily international infrastructure projects in developing countries where Enron believes there is little chance of building its wholesale and retail business around them.

All Rights Reserved. \t\n\nCOMPANIES & FINANCE UK: Budge digs deep and saves Hatfield Colliery \nFinancial Times; Oct 9, 2001\nBy ANDREW TAYLOR\n\nBrian Wilson, energy minister, yesterday welcomed the decision to restart coal production at Hatfield Colliery following the mine's rescue by Richard Budge, former chief executive of UK Coal. The Coal Authority, responsible for licensing mining, formally approved the takeover of Hatfield by Mr Budge's new company, Coal Power, paving the way for production to restart next month. Mr Budge, who earlier this year was ousted as UK Coal's chief executive, beat his former company and Enron, the US energy group, to buy Hatfield for about Pounds 5m. He was last month named preferred bidder for the colliery which went into liquidation in August. The government, in a bid to keep the pit alive, provided Pounds 6.69m of aid. \nHatfield is estimated to have coal reserves of 15m-23m tonnes. Recent rises in gas prices with more competitive electricity trading have encouraged generators to switch to more flexible coal-fired plant. Sales of domestically produced coal had risen by 20 per cent in each of the past three years, while prices paid by power stations had risen from Pounds 22.50 a tonne 18 months ago to about Pounds 35, said Mr Budge. \n\nFinancial\nLehman Buys N.Y.

Enron no longer needs Portland General to sell electricity in the West and wants to spend its money on more promising businesses, chief executive Ken Lay said. \n\nhttp://www.washingtonpost.com \nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. \t\n\nOct. 9, 2001\nHouston Chronicle\nEnron seals deal to sell Portland General utility \nBy LAURA GOLDBERG \nCopyright 2001 Houston Chronicle \nInvestors reacted positively to Enron Corp.'s announcement Monday that it sealed a deal to sell utility Portland General Electric for almost $1.9 billion. \nShares in the Houston-based energy traded finished the day up $1.72 at $33.45. \n\"It's definitely an important catalyst for the stock,\" said Raymond Niles, an analyst who follows Enron for Salomon Smith Barney. \nNorthwest Natural Gas Co. agreed to buy Portland General from the Houston-based energy trader, which has been trying to sell the utility for months. \nUnder the deal, Enron is to receive $1.55 billion in cash, $200 million in NW Natural preferred stock and $50 million in NW Natural common stock. \nNW Natural will take over Enron's $75 million balance toward consumer rate cuts Enron agreed to when it bought Portland General in 1997. \nIn addition, NW Natural, based in Portland, Ore., will assume about $1.1 billion in Portland General debt and preferred stock. \nThe common equity stake in NW Natural will give Enron voting rights limited to 4.9 percent. Enron, which has agreed to hold its securities in NW Natural for at least 2 1/2 years, also will receive up to two board seats. \nThe deal, subject to regulatory approvals, is expected to close by the fourth quarter of 2002. \nIt's the second time Enron reached a deal to sell Portland General. Nevada-based Sierra Pacific Resources agreed to buy the utility in November 1999. \nThe deal, valued at about $2 billion plus assumption of $1.1 billion debt and preferred stock, was officially called off in April, although it had been considered dead months before. \nSierra Pacific planned to sell some of its Nevada assets to raise cash for the deal, but Nevada's move to electricity deregulation was delayed and Sierra couldn't carry out the sales. \nNW Natural is Oregon's largest natural gas utility, with more than 525,000 customers in northwest Oregon and southwest Washington. \nPortland General serves more than 730,000 customers and owns 2,015 megawatts of electricity generation. \nEnron is moving away from owning large physical assets so it can focus on trading and making markets in a variety of commodities. \n\"This sale is consistent with our overall objective of selling assets that are not strategic to our wholesale and retail energy business,\" Ken Lay, Enron's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. \nEnron bought the utility in 1997 in a deal worth $2 billion, plus it assumed $1.1 billion in debt and preferred stock. \nThe NW Natural deal represents \"a break-even transaction from a gain-loss standpoint,\" Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne said. \nEnron could use the proceeds to pay down debt, repurchase stock or invest in the company's high-growth businesses, she said. \nEnron, when the deal gets closer to completion, must assure investors that the money will be invested in a higher-return opportunity to avoid earnings dilution, said Carol Coale, an analyst with Prudential Securities in Houston. \nInvestor confidence in Enron suffered after CEO Jeff Skilling, citing personal reasons, unexpectedly resigned in August. Even before then, Enron's stock had come under pressure for a variety of reasons. \nThe Portland General deal \"should add one notch in management's credibility belt,\" Coale said, adding: \"They have several notches to go.\" \n\n\nReport on Business: The Wall Street Journal\nWHAT'S NEWS\nUnited States\nWall Street Journal\n\n10/09/2001\nThe Globe and Mail\nMetro\nB15\n\"All material Copyright (c) Bell Globemedia Publishing Inc. and its licensors.

Northwest Natural is also expected to assume $1.1-billion in debt. For Enron, the move comes about five years after it bought Portland General as part of a plan to break into deregulating U.S. power markets. Since then, Enron has backed away from that strategy, in part due to the California energy crisis.\n\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

All Rights Reserved.\n\nSUSAN LISOVICZ, CNNfn ANCHOR, STREET SWEEP: As we told you earlier Enron (URL: http://.www.enron.com/) has agreed to sell its Portland General Electric unit to Northwest Natural Gas (URL: http://www.gasco.com/) for $1.9 billion. Richard Reiten is chairman and CEO of Northwest Natural Gas. He joins us from Portland, Oregon to discuss the deal. Welcome and congratulations. \nRICHARD REITEN, CHMN & CEO, NORTHWEST NAT. GAS: Thank you.\nLISOVICZ: Well the investors have spoken and so far it`s negative. Your stock is down about 40 cents. Why do you think the market`s not thrilled about what they`ve heard so far? \nREITEN: Well I don`t think being down 40 cents is really any indication in a market like today. In fact we`ve got a great transaction. Good for us, Northwest Natural Gas and certainly good for Enron. We`re able to create a five billion asset company headquartered here in Oregon. It`s going to have great growth as well as great shareholder value for Northwest National shareholders. So it`s a combination gas and electric company being created. Really we`re very excited about it. \nLISOVICZ: $1.9 billion in cash and stock. Fair price? \nREITEN: Yes. Fair for us and fair for Enron. It gives us great cash flow, great accretion to our earnings in the first year, a transaction that I think really benefits both parties. \nLISOVICZ: Will it be accretive to the bottom line in the first year? \nREITEN: Yes it will. \nLISOVICZ: OK. Tell me what shareholders can expect immediately if anything. \nREITEN: Well it`ll take a year for regulatory approval, nine to 12 months anyway. And then our first year as a combined company will most likely be 2003. We made it clear to our investors and shareholders that the transaction will be accretive in the first year even applying the old accounting rules amortizing good will. Without the good will amortization it`s double digit accretive. So it`s a very good transaction for us and our shareholders. \nLISOVICZ: How did gas prices play into this? Did they speed up or did -did they influence at all how these talks proceeded? \nREITEN: No they did not. You know gas prices have been declining rather dramatically over the last three months from highs over the previous year. But they`re coming down now and will be more moderate we think out over the next year but didn`t play any role in this. We passed through the gas cost without margin to our customers as most local gas distribution utilities do. They will play a real role because we could bring the gas supply asset storage and so on of our company to Portland General Electric`s gas-fired generation. So the combination of those assets are really a powerful set. \nLISOVICZ: What was most attractive about this property? \nREITEN: Well I think you have a almost total overlap of geography. Eighty percent of Portland General Electric`s customers are located inside Northwest Natural Gas service territory. Ninety five percent of the assets are all in Oregon. We have a small gas distribution property in southwest Washington. But there`s terrific overlap, a lot of savings for customers as we move forward to bring the companies together and certainly the accretion for our shareholders as well. \nLISOVICZ: OK. Richard Reiten, the chairman and CEO of Northwest Natural Gas. Congratulations. Thanks for joining us. \nREITEN: Thank you very much. \n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

We will try hard to incease our production capacity in the coming years,\" he said. \nThe Sichuan Basin is PetroChina's biggest gas producing area. \nThe three discoveries PetroChina made so far this year in Sichuan had a combined possible gas reserves of 25.2 bcm, another official said. \nThe Nanchong structure in central Sichuan had a gas reserve of 17.8 bcm, the Jinzhuping structure in the east contained 2.88 bcm of reserves and the Longquan structure in the west had 5.5 bcm, the official said. \nThe three structures cover a total area of 447 square km (172.6 sq miles), he said. \nExperts have predicted gas reserves in the Sichuan Basin were likely to be one trillion cubic metres by 2005. \nPetroChina has also speeded up construction of several natural gas purification plants in Sichuan, including one in the Zhongxian county of Chongqing, where a planned gas pipeline to the neighbouring province of Hubei starts, he said. \nGas purification capacity in the basin would rise to 9.0 bcm in 2004 from 5.5 bcm in 2000. \nGAS PIPELINES \nPetroChina is at the preparation stage of the Zhongxian-Hubei pipeline, China's first joint venture gas pipeline. \nThe Chinese company holds a 55 percent stake in $400 million project and U.S. energy firm Enron the remainder. \nThe two companies, which finished a feasibility study and got state approval for building the pipeline last year, were busy doing a market survey, the official said. \nThe 680 km (420 mile) pipeline, designed to transfer 3.0 bcm of natural gas a year, may be extended to the province of Hunan later, he said. \nThe Southwest Oil and Gas Co is cooperating with French firm Sofregas to upgrade more than 1,000 km of gas pipelines in Sichuan. \nThe $230 million upgrade, including repairs, cleaning and extending pipelines, would enable the trunk lines to transfer 8.0 million cubic metres per day upon completion in mid-2003, the official said.\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Unusually supple and polished version of this wine. Drink now through 2007. 4,300 cases made. (4300 cases produced) \" Have your own tasting notes?

Glorious aromas of crushed flowers, prunes, cedar and cigars.  Full-bodied, thick and tannic, yet ripe and round, with a sleek, caressing finish.  A classic Barolo that is well-priced.  Made in serious quantity.  Best after 2005\"Have your own tasting notes?

The 1999 Partridge is a over the top superstar. From the winemaker who brought us David Arthur, this wine may turn out to be one of the great California wines made.  Huge black fruit and a dark, almost to big, mid-palate.  If you are a fan of hot new California wines that ARE worth the money, this is for you.Have your own tasting notes?

I agree that among the first-growths, this wine is showing surprising forwardness and complexity in its aromatics.  It possesses an exuberant, flamboyant bouquet of roasted coffee, cassis, smoky oak, and soy sauce.  The impressive 1996 Mouton-Rothschild offers impressive aromas of black currants, framboise, coffee, and new saddle leather.  This full-bodied, ripe, rich, concentrated, superbly balanced wine is paradoxical in the sense that the aromatics suggest a far more evolved wine than the flavors reveal.  Anticipated maturity: 2007-2030.  By the way, the 1996 blend consists of 72% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Merlot, and 8% Cabernet Franc.\"Have your own tasting notes?

Slight hints of pepper and spice intermingle on the palate. A true pleasure to drink, try this with your holiday meals. This also has a lasting finish that really rounds out this wonderful wine.

It is a dead ringer for a top-notch southern Rhone wine, even though it comes from the Mediterranean city of Roussillon. It boasts a deep ruby/purple color as well as a big, thick nose of kirsch liqueur intermixed with pepper, spice, earth, and black fruits. There is excellent density, full body, and a whoppingly rich, concentrated finish. The 15% alcohol is well-hidden by the wine`s abundant fruit.

Particular is a great producer of wine for the money and this may be his best effort to date.  The 1996 Particular is massive with cherry, cassis, black currant, ruby fruit and even a hint of mint.  The mid-palate is explosive and bold with an almost velvety feel to it. This wines finish is almost overwhelming with a serious explosion of cherry fruit.Have your own tasting notes?

The work that Dave Forster did was just for front month.  That creates month 1.  Then, similar logic has to create a month 1/month 2 spread to create a month 2 outright market.

Trade shorts are quickly losing confidence based upon cash, shape of curve, and momentum.  I think curve flattens a little more and then comes down in parallel shift down.\n1.  jan and feb are highest storage adjusted prices on curve.  For market area sales, add on basis and dec and march are next.  Question is whether there is enough non-discretionary stg to meet load at other times and in the producing region.  A lot of stg has to come out either for tariff or engineering reasons.  Million dollar question.  \n2.  Think Nov bidweek will be weak.  Don't know who baseload buyers are unless trade gets bullish.  Nov is a relatively flat month as far as injections.  stg operators dont have room to buy baseload gas and I think utilities will be planning to meet load using stg.  At current prices, producers apply more pressure to wells, lng doesnt get diverted again, lose some load to resid, lose any momentum of industrial load coming back.  Dont think gas market can handle that.  \n3.  No clue.\n\n-----Original Message----- \nFrom: Abramo, Caroline \nSent: Tue 10/16/2001 10:21 PM \nTo: Arnold, John \nCc: \nSubject: market\n\n\nawesome call on cash.. it does not get any better than that.. you picked the bottom-  i am getting it slowly.. lots of calls today from people i do not speak to every day.. not too much panic from guys who are short.. most looking to put more on.. selling dec01 outright or buying gas daily puts on dec and jan... except pulaski  who pared down dec01 short with us from 4000 to 1000.. do not think he's got on alot elsewhere.  no one has anything on longer dated.. no one can figure out economy...\n \nquestions:\n1. why would any of the discretionary storage operators withdraw gas in the winter based on the current curve?\n2. where do you think index gets set this month? i am thinking that utilities will overestimate loads for Nov01 and buy more during bidweek.. index gets set high and depending on Nov weather.. it could come back onto the market weakening cash again..\n3. do you have a view on eastern power for the winter? i do not understand the market drivers in the winter.\n \nthanks very much,\nc     "

We are also in touch with the U.S. Postal Service and the Centers for Disease Control to ensure we have the most complete and up-to-date guidance for handling any possible Anthrax exposures.\n\nHowever, should you receive an envelope or package that you do not feel comfortable opening, please contact Corporate Security at extension 3-6200 and we will screen it again.\n\nTo provide Enron employees with a better understanding of  Anthrax and the potential danger it poses, we have posted a bulletin on the Corporate Security intranet site http://home.enron.com:84/security/002_bull_001.html that includes links to the CDC and USPS resources."

Christopher's Wine Warehouse was named the \"BEST WINE  STORE\" on page 97 of the September 20-26, 2001 issue.  We are  thankful to all our loyal friends and neighbors for this recognition of our hard  work and dedication to bringing the best wines we can find to Houston's wine  lovers.  Thanks again for your continued support.  We will continue to  work hard with our unique selection to, hopefully, be honored again next  year.\nAs for the schedule this week, I believe we have perfected our  website so that everyone can now view our tastings.  We have two versions  of the site, one in very easy to navigate form, and one that sings and dances if  you have the necessary plug ins.  If you don't want to re configure your  system, just click on the normal site when you visit us at:www.christopherswine.com .\nEVERY day this week,  starting tomorrow (Tuesday the 25th), we will be hosting our wine  tastings.  The topics, prices per person, etc, etc, are posted at our site  and include the weekly schedules through October.  REMEMBER: YOU MUST CALL US TO RESERVE AT  713-524-9144.  We look forward to seeing all of you.   \nAs for this week's sampler case, I decided (based on popular demand) to  extend the fabulous case from last week.  If you missed the details, here  it is again:\n\nCHRISTOPHER'S LATEST ULTIMATE  SAMPLER (2 BTLS EACH):  \n\nMartine Saunier's California Viognier 1999 (exotic, floral and a tremendous  value) $18.50 each  \nMerlin Macon La Roche Vineuse 1999 (THE greatest vintage for this  Chardonnay) $17.50 each  \nChateau Ferry Lacombe Provence Rose' 2000 (remember this one from the Wine  Bar?) $18.50 each  \nDomaine Monpertuis Ramiere Cotes du Rhone 1999 (ultra-spicey Grenache)  $17.50 each  \nDomaine de Fenouillet Beaumes de Venise CDR Villages 1999 (glad my house red  is back!) $21.50 each  \nG H von Mumm Rheingau Pinot Noir 1999 (AMAZING new discovery for me) $22.50  each  \nNormally, this case runs about $235.00\nSPECIALLY PRICED FOR E-LISTERS: $197.00 plus  tax\nAs always, please call us to order at 713-524-9144.   This case is one of my best ever, don't miss out!!!\nAS FOR SATURDAY, THE 29TH, I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE FUN TO  CELEBRATE OUR REVIEW IN THE HOUSTON PRESS!!!\nSo, from 2-5 PM,  this Saturday, at no charge, come on down and have some fun with us as we host  an amazing tasting of GREAT wines.  I will be showcasing a dozen different  wines and we will pop a few bottles of Champagne to celebrate.  Get here  early for best selection and bring some friends, too.  This Saturday will  be a blast!!!\nThat's about it for this week.  See y'all  soon.\nYour friend in wine,\nChristopher\n713-524-9144www.christopherswine. com 2516 Times  BLVD\nRice Village\n\"BEST WINE STORE IN HOUSTON\"  Houston Press 2001  "

(\"Enron\" or the \"Company\") =\n(NYSE: ENE) common stock during the period between January 18, 2000 and Oct=\nober 17, 2001, inclusive (the \"Class Period\"). A copy of the complaint file=\nd in this action is available from the Court, or can be viewed on the firm'=\ns website at http://www.classlawyer.com/pr/enron.pdf .=20\nThe complaint charges that Enron and certain of its officers and directors =\nviolated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, a=\nnd Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, by issuing a series of material misre=\npresentations to the market between January 18, 2000 and October 17, 2001, =\nthereby artificially inflating the price of Enron common stock. Specificall=\ny, the complaint alleges that Enron issued a series of statements concernin=\ng its business, financial results and operations which failed to disclose (=\ni) that the Company's Broadband Services Division was experiencing declinin=\ng demand for bandwidth and the Company's efforts to create a trading market=\n for bandwidth were not meeting with success as many of the market particip=\nants were not creditworthy; (ii) that the Company's operating results were =\nmaterially overstated as a result of the Company failing to timely write- d=\nown the value of its investments with certain limited partnerships which we=\nre managed by the Company's chief financial officer; and (iii) that Enron w=\nas failing to write-down impaired assets on a timely basis in accordance wi=\nth GAAP. On October 16, 2001, Enron surprised the market by announcing that=\n the Company was taking non-recurring charges of $1.01 billion after-tax, o=\nr ($1.11) loss per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2001, the period =\nending September 30, 2001. Subsequently, Enron revealed that a material por=\ntion of the charge related to the unwinding of investments with certain lim=\nited partnerships which were controlled by Enron's chief financial officer =\nand that the Company would be eliminating more than $1 billion in sharehold=\ner equity as a result of its unwinding of the investments. As this news beg=\nan to be assimilated by the market, the price of Enron common stock dropped=\n significantly. During the Class Period, Enron insiders disposed of over $7=\n3 million of their personally-held Enron common stock to unsuspecting inves=\ntors.\nIf you bought Enron common stock between January 18, 2000 and October 17, 2=\n001, inclusive, and you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the =\nCourt no later than December 21, 2001.

All Rights Reserved. =09\n\n\nEnron Keeps Analysts Happy as Investors Flee: Call of the Day\n2001-10-23 17:08 (New York)\n\nEnron Keeps Analysts Happy as Investors Flee: Call of the Day\n\n     New York, Oct. 23 (Bloomberg) -- Over lunch in a conference\nroom at Boston's Four Seasons Hotel last Thursday, Enron Corp.\nChairman Kenneth Lay tried to convince analysts and investors that\nthe company has no more surprises.\n\n     With the analysts, he apparently succeeded. Enron remains one\nof Wall Street's most highly rated stocks, even after the largest\nenergy trader acknowledged that transactions with partnerships run\nby its chief financial officer led to a writedown of $1.2 billion\nin shareholder equity.\n\n     Lay wasn't so successful with investors, who have abandoned\nEnron shares, slashing their value 42 percent in a week.\n\n     ``You've got a lot of people lining up to say the emperor has\nno clothes,'' said Richard Gross of Lehman Brothers Inc., who\ntoday repeated his ``strong buy'' rating on Enron. Analysts at\nCredit Suisse First Boston, Goldman, Sachs & Co. and other firms\nhave also kept their highest ratings on Enron.\n\n     Gross still likes the look of Enron's finery. ``The core\nfranchise here is very valuable,'' he said, and the stock's\ndecline more than reflects the ``worst case'' for the company.\n\n     In Boston and at similar meetings in Houston and New York,\nLay had to explain the unwinding of the partnerships. He and other\nEnron executives assured investors the company has no more\nsurprises in store, according to Greg Phelps, who manages $1.1\nbillion at John Hancock Advisers Inc., and attended the Boston\nsession.\n\n     The partnerships functioned somewhat like private equity\nfunds, according to analysts and investors, and included\ninvestments that lost money. The Securities and Exchange\nCommission has asked for more information about them, Enron said\nyesterday.\n\n                        One Hold, One Sell\n\n     While two analysts have cut their Enron ratings after\nlearning about the partnerships, they only dented the company's\npopularity on Wall Street.\n\n     Michael Heim of A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc. in St. Louis lowered\nhis rating to ``hold'' from ``buy'' on Friday. He said he has been\nlooking for discussion of the partnerships in Enron's SEC filings\nand is only seeing ``vague references'' that don't leave him with\na ``good comfort level.''\n\n     With Heim's rating change, Enron went from being the second\nmost highly rated stock in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index to the\n10th, according to Thomson Financial/First Call.\n\n     Today, Zach Wagner at Edward Jones & Co. in St. Louis cut\nEnron to ``reduce'' from ``accumulate.'' Ratings by Edward Jones,\nwhich caters to individual investors rather than institutions,\naren't tracked by First Call.\n\n     First Call translates analyst ratings into numbers, with\n``strong buy'' a one, ``buy'' a two, and so on, then averages the\nratings to rank a company's Wall Street popularity. The most\nhighly rated stock is Tyco International Ltd., which has fallen 12\npercent this year.\n\n     Enron shares fell 86 cents to $19.79 today.\n\n                        Remaining Skeptical\n\n     However highly brokerage analysts rate the stock, ``I have to\nremain skeptical,'' said Barry Borak, energy analyst at David L.\nBabson & Co., which manages $60 billion in Cambridge,\nMassachusetts.\n\n     ``There's been a huge loss of management credibility at\nEnron,'' Borak said, because of the partnerships and the\nunexpected departure in August of Jeffrey Skilling, who had held\nthe post of chief executive officer for six months and was heir\napparent to Lay. ``Nobody I've talked to thinks (Skilling's\ndeparture) is for personal reasons,'' Borak said.\n\n     Skilling helped transform Enron from a gas pipeline company\ninto the biggest energy trading company. Enron also owns power\nplants in deregulated markets.\n\n     Borak said Babson doesn't own Enron shares and won't be a\nbuyer ``until I can get better, more thorough information about\nwhat else might pop up in the future.''\n\n     Borak and other investors said Enron has a reputation for not\nproviding enough information about its businesses, and they said\nthis makes the positive view of the company on Wall Street more\ndifficult to understand.\n\n     After Skilling resigned, Lay said the company would be more\nopen about its businesses. A bullet point in his talk in Boston\nwas ``increased transparency of financial and operating results,''\naccording to a handout provided at the Boston meeting.\n\n                         Amazed, Dismayed\n\n     Prudential Securities Inc. analyst Carol Coale wrote in a\nnote to clients last week that she was ``amazed at the willingness\nof Enron's management to break out earnings and expenses to the\ndegree that it disclosed in the third quarter.''\n\n     Coale also wrote that she was ``dismayed by the apparent\n`disguise' of the additional $1.2 billion equity hit that was not\ndisclosed in (Enron's) press release and was briefly mentioned in\nthe earnings conference call.'' Coale kept her rating on Enron at\n``buy.''\n\n     Phelps at John Hancock said that his ``cynical side''\nbelieves that investment banking business has helped keep Wall\nStreet recommending Enron stock. ``They provide some good\nunderwriting business,'' he said.\n\n     Credit Suisse First Boston managed a secondary sale of 12\nmillion Enron shares in 1999, with Lehman Brothers acting\nas co-manager. Credit Suisse has also managed bond sales for\nEnron this year.\n\n\n\nEnron Asks Citigroup for $750 Mln Loan, People Say (Update1)\n2001-10-23 16:38 (New York)\n\nEnron Asks Citigroup for $750 Mln Loan, People Say (Update1)\n\n     (Updates with closing share price in sixth paragraph.)\n\n     New York, Oct. 23 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the biggest\nenergy trader, has asked Citigroup Inc. to arrange a $750 million\nloan, ensuring access to credit if the company is cut off from\nmoney markets, say people familiar with the matter.\n\n     Enron's shares and bonds plunged yesterday after the company\nsaid the Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating its\nfinances. The company depends on a $3 billion commercial paper, or\nshort-term debt, program to finance day-to-day operations.\n\n     Moody's Investors Service last week placed all $13 billion of\nthe company's long-term debt securities on watch for possible\ndowngrade. Any drop in the rating may cut off Enron from the\ncommercial paper market, raising the costs of short-term debt.\n\n     ``We understand that our credit rating is critical to both\nthe capital markets and our counterparties,'' Enron's Chief\nFinancial Officer Andrew Fastow said on a conference call today.\nHe said Enron has $3.5 billion available on bank credit lines,\ngiving it enough cash to operate normally.\n\n     Dan Noonan, a spokesman for Citigroup's Citibank NA unit,\ndeclined to comment. Mark Palmer, a spokesman for Enron, also\nwouldn't comment.\n\n     Shares of Enron, based in Houston, fell 86 cents to $19.79.\nThey have fallen 76 percent this year.\n\n                         Complex Financing\n\n     An investor sued Enron last week, saying dealings with two\npartnerships run by Fastow, LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-Investment,\ncost the company $35 million. The suit also calls Fastow's\nleadership of the partnerships, set up to remove debt from Enron's\nbooks, a conflict of interest.\n\n     Enron bought back 62 million shares to unwind positions in\nsome partnerships run by Fastow, said Chief Executive Officer Ken\nLay on the conference call with investors today.\n\n     The number of shares differs from a Wall Street Journal\nreport on Thursday that said Enron had bought back 55 million\nshares. The buyback reduced shareholder equity by $1.2 billion,\nthe Journal said.\n\n     The company set up the partnerships and other affiliated\ncompanies to buy Enron assets such as power plants. The\npartnerships allow Enron to take debt off its books, letting it\nborrow to invest in its main business of commodities trading,\nEnron said. Enron trades electricity, natural gas, oil, coal and\nother commodities.\n\n     ```They have complex off-balance sheet financing,'' said\nCommerzbank analyst Andre Mead. ``It's difficult to ascertain the\nfull impact on shareholders.''\n\n     The SEC has asked Enron about partnerships and affiliated\ncompanies headed by Fastow. The company has at least $3 billion in\nsuch ``off-the-books'' financing in affiliated companies, Ray\nNiles, a Salomon Smith Barney analyst, wrote in a report to\ninvestors.\n\n                      Depends on Asset Sales\n\n     One partnership, Whitewing Management, owns 250,000 preferred\nshares that Enron may have to convert to common stock. Whitewing\npartners can demand their preferred shares be converted if Enron\ncommon stock falls below a certain price or if Enron's credit\nrating drops under investment grade.\n\n     Whitewing and other Enron partnerships and trusts include\ncompany executives as officers and directors, according to records\nfrom the Texas secretary of state.\n\n     ``Over the life of these trust structures, Enron has in fact\nissued a sizable amount of equity,'' Enron Treasurer Ben Gilsan\nsaid. Most of that was shares issued to Enron executives as part\nof a deferred compensation plan, Gilsan said.\n\n     The Whitewing partnership was financed with $1.4 billion in\nbonds sold last year. The partnership used some of the proceeds to\nbuy Enron power plants and plans to retire the debt by selling\nthem, officials said on the conference call. Other company\npartnerships operate with the same strategy.\n\n     ``Some investors are worried the asset sales won't cover the\nfull amount (borrowed), and Enron will have to furnish support to\nthe detriment of shareholders,'' said Commerzbank analyst Meade.\n\n                      Commercial Paper Rates\n\n     Enron was paying 3.15 percent to issue commercial paper until\nOct. 31, which is as much as 15 basis points more than companies\nwith the same ``A2/P2'' short-term credit ratings that are not on\ncredit watch. Enron's short-term debt is not on review for a\npossible downgrade.\n\n     Based on Bloomberg composite ratings, most of Enron's long-\nterm debt is rated at BBB2 and BBB1, two or three levels above\ninvestment grade. Fitch, Standard & Poor's and Moody's rate the\ncompany's debt at investment grade.\n\n     Enron has previously turned to Citigroup for finance and\nadvice. In 1999, Citigroup's Salomon Smith Barney unit advised the\ncompany on its $1.45 billion acquisition of three natural gas-\nfired power plants from Cogen Technologies Inc. Citibank, along\nwith J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., this year arranged a $1.75 billion\nloan.\n\n\n\nHow Enron Blew It\nTexas Monthly\nNovember 2001\n\nLess than a year ago, the Houston-based energy behemoth had everything: mon=\ney, power, glitz, smarts, new ideas, and a CEO who wanted to make it the mo=\nst important company in the world. Now its stock is down, wall street is be=\narish, and the CEO is gone. What went wrong?\n\nby Mimi Swartz <http://www.texasmonthly.com/mag/issues/authors/mimiswartz.p=\nhp>\n=20\nTHE ENRON SKYSCRAPER NEAR THE SOUTH END OF HOUSTON'S DOWNTOWN feels like th=\ne international headquarters of the best and the brightest. The lobby in no=\n way resembles the hushed, understated entryways of the old-fashioned oil c=\nompanies, like Shell and Texaco nearby. Enron, in contrast, throbs with mod=\nernity. The people hustling in and out of the elevators are black, white, b=\nrown; Asian, Middle Eastern, European, African, as well as American-born. T=\nhey are young, mostly under 35, and dressed in the aggressively casual unif=\norm of the tech industry-the guys wear khakis, polo shirts, and Banana Repu=\nblic button-downs. Almost preposterously fit, they move through the buildin=\ng intently, like winners. Enron is nothing if not energetic: A Big Brother-=\nsize TV screen frantically reports on the stock market near a bank of eleva=\ntors, while another hefty black television relaying the same news greets pe=\nople entering from the garage. A sculpture of the corporate symbol, an E ti=\npped at a jaunty angle, radiates colors as it spins frenetically on its axi=\ns; a Starbucks concession on the ground floor keeps everyone properly caffe=\ninated. Multicolored, inspirational flags hang from the ceiling, congratula=\nting Enron on its diversity and its values; one more giant banner between e=\nlevator banks declares Enron's simple if grandiose goal: \"From the World's =\nLeading Energy Company to . . . The World's Leading Company!\"\n\nFor a while, that future seemed guaranteed, as Enron transformed itself fro=\nm a stodgy, troubled pipeline company in 1985 to a trading colossus in 2000=\n. It was a Wall Street darling, with a stock price that increased 1,700 per=\ncent in that sixteen-year period, with revenues that increased from $40 bil=\nlion to $100 billion. \"The very mention of the company in energy circles th=\nroughout the world creates reactions ranging from paralyzing fear to envy,\"=\n notes a 2001 report from Global Change Associates, a firm that provides ma=\nrket intelligence to the energy business.\n\nThis Enron was largely the creation of Jeff Skilling, a visionary determine=\nd to transform American business. Hired sixteen years ago as a consultant b=\ny then-CEO Ken Lay, Skilling helped build a company that disdained the old =\nformula of finding energy in the ground, hauling it in pipelines, and then =\nselling it to refineries and other customers. Instead, it evolved into a co=\nmpany that could trade and market energy in all its forms, from natural gas=\n to electricity, from wind to water. If you had a risky drilling venture, E=\nnron would fund it for a piece of the action. If you wanted your megacorpor=\nation's energy needs analyzed and streamlined, Enron could do the job. If y=\nou were a Third World country with a pitiful infrastructure and burgeoning =\npower needs, Enron was there to build and build. Basically, if an idea was =\nnew and potentially-and fantastically-lucrative, Enron wanted the first cra=\nck. And with each success, Enron became ever more certain of its destiny. T=\nhe company would be the bridge between the old economy and the high-tech wo=\nrld, and in February of this year, Skilling reaped his reward when he succe=\neded Lay as chief executive officer. Enron, says Skilling, \"was a great mar=\nriage of the risk-taking mentality of the oil patch with the risk-taking me=\nntality of the financial markets.\"\n\nThe Enron story reflects the culture that drove American business at the en=\nd of the twentieth century. Like the high-tech companies it emulated, Enron=\n was going to reinvent the American business model and, in turn, the Americ=\nan economy. Maybe it was natural that this Brave New World also produced a =\nculture that was based on absolutes: not just the old versus the new, but t=\nhe best versus the mediocre, the risk takers versus the complacent-those wh=\no could see the future versus those who could not. The key was investing in=\n the right kind of intellectual capital. With the best and the brightest, a=\n company couldn't possibly go wrong.\n\nOr could it? Today Enron's stock trades at around $35, down from a high of =\n$80 in January. The press cast Enron as the archvillain of California's ene=\nrgy crisis last spring, and Skilling caught a blueberry pie in the face for=\n his relentless defense of the free market. A long-troubled power plant pro=\nject in India threatened the company's global ambitions. Telecommunications=\n, in which Enron was heavily invested, imploded. Wall Street analysts who o=\nnce touted the company questioned its accounting practices. Some of the cha=\nnge in Enron's fortunes can be attributed to the economic downturn in uncer=\ntain times that has afflicted all of American business. But the culture tha=\nt the company created and lived by cannot escape blame.\n\nENRON, JEFF SKILLING SAYS, HAD \"a totally different way of thinking about b=\nusiness-we got it.\" At Enron, in fact, you either \"got it\" or you were gone=\n-it was as simple as black and white. It is not coincidental, then, that th=\ne color scheme of Skilling's River Oaks mansion mirrors the corporation he =\nonce headed. Here, the living room's white walls shimmer against the mahoga=\nny floors. Black leather trims the edge of snowy carpets. Billowy sofas set=\n off the jet-black baby grand. In the entry, white orchids cascade from a b=\nlack vase on a black pedestal table that in turn pools onto cold, white mar=\nble. There is only one off-color note: After almost twenty years, Jeff Skil=\nling is no longer associated with Enron, having resigned abruptly after jus=\nt six months as CEO. Once, Skilling was hailed as the next Jack Welch (Gene=\nral Electric's masterful CEO), as one of Worth magazine's best CEO's in Ame=\nrica (anointed in 2001), and even as a daredevil who hosted the kind of unc=\nhained adventure junkets in which, a friend told BusinessWeek, \"someone cou=\nld actually get killed.\" Today, he sounds more like Ebenezer Scrooge on Chr=\nistmas morning. \"I had no idea what I'd let go of,\" Skilling says of all th=\ne personal sacrifices he made while retooling Enron.=20\n\nFrom a black chair in the white library, across from a huge black and white=\n photograph of his daughter and two sons, Skilling clarifies. The demands o=\nf working 24-7 for Enron caused him to ignore his personal finances. Divorc=\ned, he lived in a 2,200-square-foot house without a microwave or a dishwash=\ner. He almost missed his brother's wedding. \"Learning a foreign language-I =\nnever learned a foreign language!\" he exclaims. He never once took his youn=\ngest son to school. \"I'm interested in the kids. You don't do kids in fifte=\nen-minute scheduling.\" Travel: \"You can't go to Africa for a week and get a=\nnything out of it!\" Skilling includes the study of architecture and design =\non his list of missed opportunities, then he stops and sighs. \"I'm not sure=\n that fulfillment in life is compatible with a CEO's job,\" he says, finally=\n. Then his eyes lock on mine, and his voice, which had softened, regains it=\ns pragmatic edge. \"It would have been easy to stay,\" he says. \"But that wou=\nld not have been good for me.\"=20\n\nHe's a smallish, ruddy-faced man who keeps himself at fighting weight, hand=\nsome in the way of corporate titans, with piercing cheekbones and that assi=\nduously stolid gaze. But the impatience Skilling once reserved for cautious=\n underlings and dull-witted utility company executives is now targeted at r=\neporters who have labeled his resignation \"bizarre\" and associates who are =\nbitterly skeptical of his need for family time. His shrug stretches the lim=\nits of his shimmering blue button-down, and his matching blue eyes look put=\n upon. \"I'm surprised,\" he says, \"that people have so much trouble understa=\nnding this.\"\n\nPEOPLE WHO PASSED THROUGH DOWNTOWN HOUSTON in the late eighties or early ni=\nneties couldn't help but notice a funny and, for its time, novel scene unfo=\nlding throughout the workday at the base of the Enron Building. From nine t=\no five and before and after, you could see people slipping out of the prist=\nine silver skyscraper to smoke. They perched on the chrome banisters or lur=\nked near the glass doors at the entry, puffing like mad. They always looked=\n hurried and furtive, even ashamed. Whatever people knew about Enron in tho=\nse days (and most people didn't know much), it was often associated with th=\nat scene: Enron boasted one of the first nonsmoking corporate headquarters =\nin Houston, and there couldn't have been clearer evidence of its break with=\n the energy world of the past. What macho engineer would have put up with s=\nuch humiliation?\n\nBut this company was a child of another time, that period in the mid-eighti=\nes when chaos enveloped the gas business. Federal deregulation of natural g=\nas turned a steady, secure industry, in which gas pipeline companies freque=\nntly enjoyed a monopoly in portions of the areas that they served, into a v=\nolatile free-for-all. The situation was compounded five years later by fede=\nral deregulation of the pipeline business. So it happened that a gentlemanl=\ny gas pipeline company, Houston Natural Gas (HNG) found itself under attack=\n from Coastal Corporation, Oscar Wyatt's less than gentlemanly firm. HNG wa=\ns then run by Lay, a sturdy, taciturn former economics professor and Transc=\no chief operating officer who had a passion for military strategy. (His doc=\ntoral thesis at the University of Houston was on supply and demand in the V=\nietnam War.) Lay, who was from Missouri and never succumbed-at least outwar=\ndly-to Texas brashness, had done well enough: Thanks to canny expansions, H=\nNG's pipelines stretched from Florida to California and throughout the stat=\ne of Texas.\n\nHNG fended off Coastal, but to protect the company from other takeover atte=\nmpts, Lay nimbly engineered the sale of HNG in 1985 to a friendly Nebraska =\npipeline concern called InterNorth, one of the largest pipeline companies i=\nn the country at the time. Then, a funny thing happened: HNG started acting=\n in a way that would characterize the company for years to come-a lot like =\nCoastal. What the Nebraskans blithely labeled \"the purchase\" was being call=\ned \"the merger\" back in Houston, and before long, following some particular=\nly brutal politicking between Omaha and Houston, the company's center of gr=\navity started shifting toward Texas, and shortly after that, Ken Lay was ru=\nnning a new company called Enron. \"Over time it became clear that Lay had a=\n better vision of the future,\" says one person associated with Enron at tha=\nt time. \"He never fought change. He embraced change.\"\n\nLay had won, but what exactly did that mean? Enron was saddled with massive=\n debt from the takeover attempt, and thanks to deregulation, no longer had =\nexclusive use of its pipelines. Without new ideas-for that matter, a whole =\nnew business plan-the company could be finished before it really even got s=\ntarted.=20\n\nLIKE MANY PEOPLE WHO TEAMED UP WITH ENRON IN THE EIGHTIES, Jeff Skilling ha=\nd spent a lot of time in the Midwest, and he was self-made-at fourteen he h=\nad been the chief production director at a start-up TV station in Aurora, I=\nllinois. (His mother would drop him off there every day after school.) \"I l=\niked being successful when I was working, and I was smart,\" he told Busines=\nsWeek earlier this year. But unlike many of his Enron colleagues, Skilling =\nwasn't deliberate and soft-spoken and happy to go home at five o'clock; he =\nwas anxious and excitable, and nothing, but nothing excited him more than w=\nhat he would come to call \"intellectual capital.\" He loved being smart, and=\n he loved being surrounded by smart people. He graduated from Southern Meth=\nodist University, went into banking-assets and liability management-and too=\nk on Harvard Business School, where he graduated in the top 5 percent of hi=\ns class. Then Skilling took the next step on what was then the new, souped-=\nup path to American success: He joined Manhattan's McKinsey and Company as =\na business consultant, and that is where Ken Lay found him in 1985.=20\n\nIt is often said of Lay that his instincts for hiring the best are flawless=\n, and his choice of Skilling probably saved the company. Skilling was above=\n all an expert at markets and how they worked. While everyone else was worr=\nying about the gluts and the shortages that defined the gas industry, he al=\none saw the parallels between gas and other businesses. And so in a world w=\nhere credit was nearly impossible to come by, Skilling came up with what he=\n called the Gas Bank, which contractually guaranteed both the supply and th=\ne price of gas to a network of suppliers and consumers. Enron would not be =\na broker but a banker. It would buy and sell the gas itself and assume the =\nrisk involved. And Enron would make money on transactions, much like an inv=\nestment bank would.\n\nSkilling worked up some numbers and found them \"absolutely compelling.\" The=\nn the McKinsey consultant took the idea to a meeting of about 25 Enron exec=\nutives. He had a one-page presentation. \"Almost to a person,\" Skilling says=\n, \"they thought it was stupid.\" Almost. After Skilling left the meeting dej=\nected, he walked Ken Lay to an elevator and apologized. Lay listened and th=\nen said, \"Let's go.\"\n\nThe Gas Bank was not an overnight success. For months Skilling woke up in a=\n cold sweat, sure he had ruined not only his career but the careers of doze=\nns of colleagues who had assisted him. In fact, he had come upon one of tho=\nse divides that seem to define his life: \"I believed this whole world would=\n be different, a huge breakthrough\" is the way Skilling puts it today, and =\neven if he is typically immodest, he was right. Fairly soon after launching=\n, the company sold $800 million worth of gas in a week. True to Skilling's =\ncharacter, success turned out to be a matter of old versus new: He says the=\n joke around Enron was that if a company's CEO was under fifty, \"We were in=\n.\" And he was in too: In 1990 Skilling finally left McKinsey and joined Enr=\non as the head of Enron Finance Corporation, a new division created just fo=\nr him. In 1991 that company closed a deal that earned $11 million in profit=\n. After that, says Skilling, \"we never looked back.\"\n\nSkilling and Lay also realized that the Gas Bank couldn't work unless it ha=\nd a trading component. Myriad trades were needed to build the market that w=\nould make the project go. But by buying and selling enormous quantities of =\ngas, Enron not only constructed a market but almost instantly came to domin=\nate it. The company had the best contacts, the best intelligence, and the b=\nest access to supplies. That, in turn, attracted more customers who wanted =\nto be part of the play. With so many customers in its pocket, Enron could b=\netter predict the direction of the market and could use that knowledge to m=\nake trades for its own benefit-Enron could in effect bet on which way the p=\nrice of gas would go, as one might do with pork bellies or soybeans, but wi=\nth startling accuracy, thereby generating profits higher than anyone could =\nhave ever imagined.\n\nTHIS CHANGE COULD NEVER HAVE OCCURRED without another change Skilling had m=\nade: He created, within Enron, a new culture to match its new trading busin=\ness. The idea was to build a \"knowledge-based business,\" which demanded a s=\nkill set not exactly prized by Enron's employees from the old HNG days. Mos=\nt were deliberate, cautious, responsible, somewhat defensive people, most o=\nf them men, of course-the kind of people you'd expect to find working in an=\n industry regulated by the federal government. But now the company needed b=\nolder people for its bold new era: that included anyone who wanted to make =\nmoney-lots of money-for themselves and for the company. \"Enron was going to=\n create a niche for itself or die,\" one former executive explains. \"The peo=\nple who had narrow views eventually were forced out, because if they had na=\nrrow views about other things, they had narrow views about the market.\"\nSkilling wanted smart people but not just any smart people. He wanted the s=\nmartest people from schools like Harvard, Stanford, and maybe, Rice. And be=\ncause his firm was now acting more like a bank than a pipeline company, he =\nwanted to draw from the pool of recruits that would be attracted to the big=\ngest and best investment banks, like Merrill Lynch or Credit Suisse First B=\noston. In addition to being smart, Enron people were also supposed to be \"a=\nggressive.\" You were right for Enron if you didn't want to wait until you w=\nere thirty to close your own deals or move up in an organization.=20\nYou could see what he was looking for on \"Super Saturdays\" at the Houston h=\neadquarters: eight fifty-minute interviews with ten minute breaks in betwee=\nn-the company might herd as many as four hundred people through in just one=\n day. They were scored from 1 to 5 on their smarts, their problem-solving a=\nbility, their passion for hard work, and what at Enron was called \"a sense =\nof urgency.\" People who scored less than 2.5 were scratched. The shrewdest =\ncandidates knew how to work Enron before they were even hired: These were t=\nhe types that automatically turned down the company's first offer, knowing =\nEnron would come back with more. The starting salary was around $80,000. Ma=\nybe it wasn't a fortune-yet-but the signing bonus, about $20,000, was more =\nthan enough for a lease on the obligatory Porsche Boxster or one of the lof=\nts being renovated close to downtown. (Enron people didn't live in far-flun=\ng suburbs. Suburbs were uncool and too far from the office.)\nFor the lucky winners, Enron offered the corporate equivalent of a gifted-a=\nnd-talented program. New associates learned the latest techniques for struc=\nturing energy deals, and there were rotations at Enron offices around the g=\nlobe. The hours were long, but every possible need was taken care of. A com=\npany concierge handled all the things important people couldn't be bothered=\n with: picking up dry cleaning or prescriptions, shining shoes, cleaning th=\ne house, planning a vacation. Of course, a lot of people who worked for Enr=\non never got to take vacations-they were too busy making money-but they cou=\nld use the company gym and the company's personal trainers. If they were ov=\nerweight or wanted to quit smoking, they could join Enron's Wellness Progra=\nm. Massages were offered six days a week, from seven in the morning until t=\nen at night. \"They were so cutting edge,\" rhapsodizes someone involved with=\n the company health care program at the time. \"They really thought about th=\ne psychology and what it took to keep these people going.\"\nSkilling handed out titles analogous to those at Wall Street firms-analysts=\n, associates, directors, and managing directors-but everyone knew that thos=\ne titles didn't really matter. Money did. Instead of competitive salaries a=\nnd decent bonuses, Enron offered competitive salaries and merit-based bonus=\nes-with no cap. \"If you really worked hard and delivered results, you could=\n make a lot of money,\" says Ken Rice, who stayed with Enron for 21 years un=\ntil resigning recently as the head of the company's faltering broadband div=\nision. Or, as the saying goes, you got to eat what you killed. Gas traders =\nwith two or three years of experience could wind up with a $1 million bonus=\n. And the more you produced, the closer you got to Jeff: Real hot dogs join=\ned him glacier hiking in Patagonia, Land Cruiser racing in Australia, or of=\nf-road motorcycling in a re-creation of the Baja 1,000 race, ending at a sp=\nectacular Mexican villa. \"Every time he'd speak, I'd believe everything he'=\nd say,\" one loyalist says.=20\nAnd why not? By 1995 Enron had become North America's largest natural-gas m=\nerchant, controlling 20 percent of the market. But at a company where the b=\nuzzword was \"aggressive,\" that was no place to stop: Skilling and Lay belie=\nved the Gas Bank model could easily be applied to the electricity business.=\n Firmly committed to the notion that a deregulated market meant better serv=\nice at lower prices for consumers (and untold profits for Enron), they bega=\nn barnstorming the country, pressing their case with entrenched power compa=\nny presidents (who, with their multimillion-dollar salaries and monopoly se=\nrvice areas, had little incentive to change) and energy regulators (who wer=\ne somewhat more receptive, thanks in part to Enron's generous lobbying effo=\nrts).\nBut the biggest winner of all was probably Jeff Skilling. In 1997 Ken Lay m=\nade him the president and chief operating officer of the company. By then, =\nthe division known as Enron Capital and Trade Resources was the nations lar=\ngest wholesale buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity. The divisio=\nn had grown from two hundred to two thousand employees, and revenues from $=\n2 billion to $7 billion. \"Mr. Skilling's experience so far with the turmoil=\n in the industry has convinced him that he is on the right track,\" the New =\nYork Times noted. Everyone would certainly have thought so: Enron and Skill=\ning had totally transformed one industry and were well on their way to tran=\nsforming another.\n\"FIRING UP AN IDEA MACHINE; Enron Is Encouraging the Entrepreneurs Within,\"=\n sang the New York Times in 1999. \"In the staid world of regulated utilitie=\ns and energy companies, Enron Corp is that gate-crashing Elvis,\" crowed For=\ntune in 2000. Wall Street was demanding tech-size growth on a tech timetabl=\ne, and Enron, in 2000, obliged with second quarter earnings of $289 million=\n, up 30 percent from the previous year. That year the company seemed to dis=\ncover a market a minute: Under Skilling, Enron was trading coal, paper, ste=\nel, and even weather. No one blinked when a London wine bar became an Enron=\n client. People drank more in warm weather than cold, so why not buy a hedg=\ne against the usual winter downturn?\nBut most exciting to the financial world was Enron's entry into high-tech c=\nommunications. Because of the company's marketing dominance, EnronOnline be=\ncame another overnight success, handling $335 billion in commodity trades o=\nnline in 2000. Enron, as usual, made its money on the spread between the bi=\nd price and the asking price. Then there was the broadband business: To Enr=\non, trading excess capacity in large, high-speed fiber-optic networks (empt=\ny lanes on the fabled information highway) wasn't that different from tradi=\nng the capacity of natural gas pipelines. So Enron created a market for wha=\nt the industry calls bandwidth. Soon after, it also announced a twenty-year=\n deal with Blockbuster to deliver movies on demand electronically to people=\n in their homes. Enron looked like a company that couldn't lose. \"Its strat=\negy of building businesses, shedding hard assets, and trading various commo=\ndities can help it do well even in an uncertain market,\" BusinessWeek insis=\nted.\nThere was, however, another reason Enron did so well in such a short time: =\nthe company's hard-nosed approach toward its customers. The old notion of c=\nustomer service was based on the long haul-you had to nurse and coddle cust=\nomers to keep them. But Enron had new markets and new ideas-customers had t=\no come to it. Over time, the company stopping referring to its business cli=\nents as customers and began calling them \"counterparties.\"\nSkilling wanted the biggest profits on the shortest timetable: Gains were m=\naximized by creating, owning, and then abandoning a market before it became=\n overtaxed and overregulated. So if you wanted to launch a high-risk ventur=\ne quickly-such as Zilkha Energy's new high-tech approach to drilling for oi=\nl-you got your financing from Enron because a bank would take forever to un=\nderwrite the project, if it ever would. But because Enron invented its mark=\nets and subsequently dominated them, Enron could set the terms of its deals=\n, from the timeline to the method of accounting to whether the deal happene=\nd at all.=20\nWhile many businesses used what was known in the industry as \"mark-to-marke=\nt accounting,\" for instance, Enron used it on an unprecedented scale. The c=\nompany priced their deals at current market value-but it was always Enron's=\n idea of the market value; companies that balked at their pricing didn't ge=\nt deals. And while old-fashioned companies spread their profits out like an=\nnuities over a period of years, Enron took most of its profit up-front. How=\never many millions would be made on a deal that covered several years, they=\n went on the books in the current year. If a few analysts thought there mig=\nht be something fishy about what they called \"subjective accounting,\" inves=\ntors didn't particularly care as long as the profits rolled in. As the mark=\net fluctuated and the landscape changed, the company might abandon a projec=\nt that had been in the works for months because its profit margins weren't =\ngoing to be high enough. \"Enron is known for leaving people at the altar,\" =\nsays one former employee. Winning the highest possible profits for the comp=\nany could even extend to Enron's attitude toward charity. When a fundraiser=\n for the Houston READ Commission, a literacy group, called on Enron for a c=\nontribution, it was suggested that he start raising money for Enron's compe=\nting literacy charity: \"Even the person who was supposed to give money away=\n for Enron was supposed to make money for Enron,\" he says.\nAs Enron became more and more successful, the culture Skilling had created =\ntook on a dark side: The competition turned inward. As one member of the En=\nron family put it, \"It became a company full of mercenaries.\" The change st=\narted at the bottom. As Enron's domination of the energy market grew, most =\nof the recruiting frills fell away. New associates were treated much like t=\nhe commodities the company traded. Global Change's Enron spies reported ove=\nrhearing orders like \"I need a smart person-go buy me one\" or \"Buy me an in=\ntelligent slave, quick.\" Enron had never been the kind of place where peopl=\ne sang to you on your birthday, but now the workaholism bordered on self-pa=\nrody: A Random Acts of Kindness program lasted only a few months. It was to=\no disruptive. People couldn't get their work done.\nAnd, of course, Enron had a program for institutionalizing creative tension=\n. The Performance Review Committee, which had initially been installed by S=\nkilling in the Capital group, became known as the harshest forced ranking s=\nystem in the country. Employees were rated on a scale of one to five, and t=\nhose with fives were usually gone within six months. (The PRC's nickname qu=\nickly became \"rank and yank.\") It was a point of pride that Skilling's divi=\nsion replaced 15 percent of its workforce every year. As one Skilling assoc=\niate put it, \"Jeff viewed this like turning over the inventory in a grocery=\n store.\" Skilling's approach to business-get in and get out-had become Enro=\nn's attitude toward its workers. In time, it would become many workers' att=\nitude toward the company. Teamwork, never that valuable in a trading cultur=\ne, went the way of the eyeshade and the abacus. If protocol required an Enr=\non higher-up to come from Europe to help with a project in the Third World,=\n he might help-or he might not, depending on whether another, potentially m=\nore lucrative project was pending elsewhere.\nEveryone felt the pressure to perform on a massive scale at massive speed: =\n\"They were so goal oriented toward immediate gratification that they lost s=\night of the future,\" says one former employee. Anyone who couldn't close de=\nals within a quarter was punished with bad PRC scores, as were the higher-u=\nps who had backed them. Past errors and old grudges were dredged up so ofte=\nn as new ammunition in PRC meetings that the phrase \"No old tapes\" became a=\nn Enron clich?. \"People went from being geniuses to idiots overnight,\" says=\n one former Enron executive.\nIn such a hothouse, paranoia flowered. New contracts contained highly restr=\nictive confidentiality agreements about anything pertaining to the company.=\n E-mail was monitored. A former executive routinely carried two laptops, on=\ne for the company and one for himself. People may have been rich at Enron, =\nbut they weren't necessarily happy. One recruiter described the culture thi=\ns way: \"They roll you over and slit your throat and watch your eyes while y=\nou bleed to death.\"\nBEFORE JEFF SKILLING COULD TRANSFORM ENRON from the world's leading energy =\ncompany into the world's leading company, he had to make one more change: J=\nust as he had done ten years before, Skilling had to purge the company of i=\nts remaining old order. Where Enron once prized cautious executives who dea=\nlt with tangible assets like pipelines, it now valued bold executives who d=\nealt with intangible assets. Pipelines, power plants-they may have been Enr=\non's pride, but Skilling wanted them gone. Expensive, long-term building pr=\nojects had no place when Wall Street was devoted to quick profits and enorm=\nous returns on investment capital, and Skilling knew it. \"It wasn't the tim=\ne for long-term approaches,\" an Enron executive says of Wall Street's mood.=\n \"It was the technology era.\"\nTo rid Enron of the last vestiges of its past, Skilling had to take on Rebe=\ncca Mark, long considered his rival for the CEO's job. Mark was for many ye=\nars the poster child for the Enron way: Young, attractive, aggressive-her n=\nickname was Mark the Shark-she came from sturdy Midwestern stock but had th=\ne requisite Harvard MBA. Mark was largely responsible for the success of En=\nron International, the asset-heavy side of the company where she developed =\n$20 billion worth of gas and power plants, which accounted for 40 percent o=\nf Enron's profits in 1998. For this she reaped breathtaking compensation-on=\ne Enron executive estimated $10 million-and adoring press clips, including =\ntwo appearances on Fortune's list of the fifty most powerful women in corpo=\nrate America.\nBut then Mark ran into trouble with a gas-fired power plant in Dabhol, Indi=\na, one of the largest ever constructed. She had played the game the Enron w=\nay: Taking Enron into a new market, she had finagled low import taxes (20 p=\nercent instead of the usual 53) and hung in through 24 lawsuits and three c=\nhanges in government. But the time and expense needed to make India and oth=\ner Enron plants around the globe successful did not mesh with Enron's goals=\n, and Skilling's impatience with Mark grew.\nForcing Mark out, however, was no easy matter. Key executives left, divisio=\nns were dismantled, but she remained. The truth was Enron didn't mind firin=\ng lower-level employees, but it hated to fire the kind of aggressive, relen=\ntless people it tended to promote. The company preferred humiliation-keepin=\ng a director in his cubicle, say, but failing to include him in the glamour=\n deals, or kicking someone upstairs with a fancy title. (One particularly d=\nifficult executive won a few years at graduate school, gratis.) A company a=\ns smart as Enron could probably deduce too that dispatching one of the most=\n visible businesswomen in the country would provoke a public-relations disa=\nster. So Lay and Skilling did something classically Enronian: They gave Mar=\nk her own company. Despite Skilling's contempt for asset-heavy businesses, =\nEnron spent more than $2 billion to buy a run-of-the-mill British water uti=\nlity that could serve as Enron's entry into the emerging world of water pri=\nvatization. Mark was put in charge of making Enron, yes, the world's greate=\nst water company. Azurix, as the new business was called, looked like anoth=\ner sure thing: Its IPO in 1999 raised $695 million.=20\nBut Mark had to succeed on Enron's increasingly abbreviated timetable in a =\nbusiness fraught with political and emotional complexities. Water is not li=\nke gas or electricity-owners and governments are a lot less willing to give=\n it up, even for lots of money. The company stumbled, layoffs commenced, an=\nd confidence evaporated. By August 2000 the stock price, which had started =\nout at $19, had fallen to $5. Mark's resignation followed, and Azurix, much=\n diminished, was folded into Enron. \"I think it's best for Rebecca to start=\n afresh,\" Lay, who had been a mentor to Mark, told the Wall Street Journal.=\n Or as one critic put it, \"They were more interested in destroying the old =\nculture than running a business.\"=20\nAs 2000 drew to a close, Skilling was in total command. In December Ken Lay=\n announced the inevitable: \"The best time for the succession to occur is wh=\nen the company is doing well,\" he told the press. \"Enron is doing extremely=\n well now.\" In February 2001 Jeff Skilling took over the CEO's job.\nALMOST IMMEDIATELY THE TROUBLE STARTED. Enron's domination of the electric-=\npower market made it an instant target in the California deregulation debac=\nle. Both PBS's Frontline and the New York Times took on Enron, portraying t=\nhe company as a heartless colossus that used its influence in Washington (L=\nay and Enron's political action committee are the top contributors to Georg=\ne W. Bush) to force old people on fixed incomes to choose between buying fo=\nod or electricity. Skilling and Lay appeared on camera singing belligerent =\nanthems to the free market, while another memorable scene juxtaposed one of=\n the company's jackallike traders against a hapless state employee in Calif=\nornia, as both tried to buy power online. The Times reported that Lay had t=\nried to persuade a new federal commissioner to change his views on energy d=\neregulation. The bad press was, to say the least, ironic: Just as the media=\n was pounding Enron for its omnipotence, Wall Street was discovering its we=\naknesses. By late March the stock price had slid to $50 a share from $80 in=\n January.\nWithin Enron, the asset-based divisions took the rap for the decline. (The =\nIndia plant continued to be enormously costly, at least in part because of =\nconstant turnover within Enron's management team.) But the California situa=\ntion was more visible and therefore more damaging, despite Enron's claim th=\nat the state had never built enough power plants to service its population =\nand never properly managed those it had. \"For three months Gray Davis did a=\n very good job of blaming us,\" says Mark Palmer, a vice president for corpo=\nrate communications. \"We were a Texas company. There was a Texan in the Whi=\nte House. California was a state that didn't put him in office, and his big=\ngest contributor was a Texas energy company. Performance is going to take c=\nare of our stock price. The truth will take care of Gray Davis.\" (Californi=\na utilities still owe Enron $500 million, another reason stockholders might=\n be panicky.) But more problematic than the crisis itself was Skilling's al=\nl too apparent lack of contrition. Facing down his critics, he cracked a jo=\nke comparing California with the Titanic. (\"At least the Titanic went down =\nwith its lights on.\")\nBut the biggest problem was Enron's telecommunications division, which had =\nbeen responsible for at least one third of its heady stock price. Investors=\n believed that Enron could revolutionize high-speed communications, just as=\n it had revolutionized gas and power. Enron estimated the global market for=\n buying and selling space over fiber-optic cable would grow from $155 billi=\non in 2001 to $383 billion by 2004-but then the tech bubble burst. So too d=\nid the much-hyped movies-on-demand deal with Blockbuster. For the first tim=\ne in its confoundingly successful life, Enron had nothing new to take to ma=\nrket. Like the popular high school girl who suddenly packs on a few pounds,=\n Enron suddenly looked less alluring to Wall Street.\nSkilling launched a campaign to keep Enron's most important cheerleaders, t=\nhe stock analysts, in the tent, but he wasn't cut out to be a supplicant. D=\nuring the reporting of first quarter profits, he called an analyst who chal=\nlenged Enron's financial reporting an \"asshole.\" When the company reported =\nhefty second quarter profits, many analysts questioned whether those profit=\ns had come from the generation of new business or from the sale of old asse=\nts. Ignoring the growing chorus critical of Enron's accounting, Skilling pr=\nomised, as he always had, that innovations were just around the corner. \"Th=\nere wasn't any positive news,\" Carol Coale, of Prudential Financial, says n=\now. \"Basically, he talked me out of a downgrade.\"\nThe business press, so generous in the past, turned surly. Fortune had aske=\nd in March whether Enron was overpriced. (\"Start with a pretty straightforw=\nard question: How exactly does Enron make its money?\") The routine cashing =\nin of stock options that were about to expire by key executives was portray=\ned in the media as a fire sale. (Skilling had sold $33 million worth, Ken L=\nay and Ken Rice close to four times that amount.) Then the Wall Street Jour=\nnal reported on a fund run by the CFO that had been a source of strife with=\nin the company. (It was essentially risk management against Enron's possibl=\ne failures.) Every negative story seemed to produce a concurrent drop in th=\ne stock price: By late August it had fallen below $40. Enron, so institutio=\nnally unforgiving, finally got a taste of its own medicine. \"When Wall Stre=\net is in love with a stock, they're forgiving of something like accounting,=\n\" says Carol Coale. \"When a company falls out of favor, all these issues ca=\nrry more weight.\"\nThis fact was not lost on people inside the company, who suddenly started e=\nxperiencing an attack of conscience. Those who had looked the other way as =\nthe most powerful Enron executives dumped their wives and married their sec=\nretaries or carried on flagrant interoffice affairs now saw the error of th=\neir ways. \"It just created an attitude,\" one executive still at Enron says.=\n \"If senior people are doing that, why are we held to a higher standard? Th=\nere was a real culture of 'We're above everyone else.'\"=20\nLoyalty had never been prized at Enron, so there was no reason to expect it=\n now. An old-fashioned, slow-moving company like Exxon could demand hardshi=\np duty in Baku with the promise of greater rewards down the road. \"But,\" as=\n one Houston oilman explains, \"if you have to negotiate a hardship duty wit=\nh someone who doesn't have loyalty and has money, then you have a corporati=\non that's better suited for good times than bad.\"\nAs it turned out, that description applied to Jeff Skilling too. As the sto=\nck price stubbornly refused to ascend, he made no secret of his unhappiness=\n and frustration. Then, after a trip to visit the families of three employe=\nes killed at a plant in England, he had an epiphany: Life was short; for hi=\nm, Enron was over. Ever stoic, Ken Lay returned to the CEO's office, named =\na new president, arranged a trip to New York to calm analysts and investors=\n, and promised a kinder, gentler Enron in the future. Trading anything and =\neverything was out. The company, Lay says, will still innovate but \"innovat=\ne much closer to our core.\" As for the culture: \"Things like the Performanc=\ne Review Committee, I think we could have applied better. By trying to cate=\ngorize people into so many different categories, you ended up creating a mo=\nrale problem.\"\nThat Skilling's supposedly brilliant colleagues were as shocked at the news=\n of his departure as the rest of the business community may be testament to=\n their lack of emotional intelligence. Despite Skilling's lengthy tenure wi=\nth Enron, he'd always been contemptuous of the long haul; he'd always belie=\nved in cutting losses and moving on. But now that he was abandoning them wh=\nen the company was in trouble, it was different. \"Even Jeff's biggest detra=\nctors wouldn't have wanted him to walk out the door,\" one loyalist admits.\nBut on the day we meet, Skilling is looking forward, not back. \"Look,\" he s=\nays with finality, \"ninety percent of my net worth is in Enron. Were my int=\nerests aligned with the shareholders? Absolutely.\"\nFree of falling stock prices and shareholder pressures, he is nestling hims=\nelf back into the world of ideas. His eyes flash as he talks about new tech=\nnologies. \"The first wave never gets it right,\" he says. \"The stand-alone d=\not-coms didn't work, but the technological applications will create a secon=\nd wave that will change the world.\" Houston, he promises, will become the w=\norld's center of commodity trading, and he intends to be a part of it. In f=\nact, he is already shopping for office space.\n\"This is the second wave, and Enron's got it,\" he says, almost breathless. =\n\"There are thousands of people running around the streets of Houston that g=\net it.\"\n\n\n\nEnron Fails to Smooth Things Over\nBy Peter Eavis <mailto:peavis@thestreet.com>\nSenior Columnist\nTheStreet.com\n10/23/2001 01:07 PM EDT\nURL: <http://www.thestreet.com/markets/detox/10002864.html>\n\nEnron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) held a special conference call Tuesday=\n to address investor concerns that have weighed heavily on its stock.=20\nBut worries may persist after the energy trader offered few new details and=\n the CEO publicly sparred with a gadfly investor over a shadowy off-balance=\n sheet transaction.=20\nThe transaction that has drawn most attention in the past week is a complex=\n financing that Enron entered into with a partnership called LJM2, which wa=\ns led by Enron's finance chief Andrew Fastow. Terminating this arrangement =\nled to a $1.2 billion equity reduction in the third quarter. Monday, Enron =\nstock plunged 20% after the company said the Securities and Exchange Commis=\nsion is probing \"related party transactions.\" Executives declined to respon=\nd to questions about Fastow's role in the LJM2 partnership on the Tuesday c=\nall.=20\nAnother key issue is the impact of the equity reduction. The company said o=\nn the call that its share count would decline by 60 million in the fourth q=\nuarter, due to the termination of the LJM2 financing. But CEO Ken Lay said =\nthe company wouldn't be increasing its earnings guidance of $1.80 a share f=\nor 2001 and $2.15 for 2002.=20\nWhen a share count drops, earnings per share should normally increase, assu=\nming the earnings number stays constant. The 60 million shares are equivale=\nnt to about 6.5% of the company's diluted total in the third quarter. As a =\nresult, Enron should have raised its per-share profits forecast by about th=\nat much, assuming constant earnings.=20\nWhen asked on the call if earnings per share guidance would be increasing, =\nCEO Lay replied that the company had previously increased its guidance for =\nthis year. He then affirmed the 2002 number.=20\nNow, to be fair, Enron may not be forecasting lower earnings. The planned r=\neduction in shares may simply bring the total share count back close to a l=\nevel in the fourth quarter and 2002 that analysts had originally expected. =\nNotably, the share count in the third quarter jumped by 20 million, meaning=\n a fourth-quarter reduction might not change matters that much. Alternative=\nly, Enron may beat fourth-quarter estimates by 6.5%; perhaps the company ha=\ns simply chosen not to increase guidance at this stage, given uncertainties=\n in the economy. In any case, more clarity on this matter is clearly needed=\n.=20\nCalls to Enron weren't immediately returned. The stock edged up 2% Tuesday =\nafter falling nearly 40% since last week amid worries about complex off-bal=\nance sheet deals.=20\nThe call, arranged after Enron's Monday plunge, contained a lot of queries =\nabout two trusts, called Marlin II and Whitewing, against which Enron borro=\nwed some $3.4 billion. Lay became testy after questioning by Richard Grubma=\nn of Boston-based hedge fund Highfields Capital Management. Grubman, who wa=\ns called an \"a--hole\" by Enron's former CEO Jeff Skilling on an April confe=\nrence call, was trying to find out the value of water assets held by Marlin=\n II. The optimal way of paying back money borrowed through the trust is to =\nsell the water assets.=20\nGrubman's line of questioning implied that the Marlin assets were worth onl=\ny about $100 million, meaning Enron would have to find about $900 million t=\no pay off the Marlin II-related debt. Grubman arrived at $100 million after=\n factoring in what he saw as the effects of a third-quarter writedown to wa=\nter assets, some of which are included in Marlin II.=20\nLay disputed the $100 million number. At one point, he accused Grubman of d=\nriving Enron's stock down and monopolizing the Tuesday conference call. In =\nthe middle of Grubman's comments, Lay told the call operator to go to the n=\next caller.=20\nGrubman didn't immediately return a call seeking comment.=20\nIf Enron has to find $900 million, this can be done by issuing stock or rai=\nsing cash on its balance sheet. If the latter route is taken, Enron says it=\n's likely to use asset sales to generate the cash. Enron executives said li=\nquidity would be sufficient and detailed at least $3.35 billion in availabl=\ne credit lines.=20\nBut if Enron's debt-to-capital ratio exceeds 65%, the covenants on some of =\nthose lines are broken. After the $1.2 billion equity writedown and other c=\nharges taken in the third quarter, that ratio is probably about 50%-55% (En=\nron hasn't released a third-quarter balance sheet to arrive at an exact cal=\nculation). It would take $3 billion in further writedowns or charges to pus=\nh Enron's debt-to-capital ratio up to 65%.=20\n\nStocks=20\nMore Static For Enron=20\nForbes.com staff, Forbes.com\n10.23.01, 11:15 AM ET=20\n\nNEW YORK - Enron scrambled again to reassure investors this morning, after =\nit disclosed yesterday that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had=\n asked for information on partnerships run by Chief Financial Officer Andre=\nw Fastow and other executives.=20\n\nEnron (nyse: ENE ) last week reported a third-quarter loss of $638 million =\nafter taking $1.01 billion in charges on ill-fated investments. The market =\ntook that in stride until media reports parsed the earnings announcement an=\nd disclosed that $35 million of those losses were connected with the two li=\nmited partnerships run by Fastow. Enron shares, which plunged 23% last week=\n, nosedived another 21% yesterday. Enron bounced back slightly in morning t=\nrading.=20\nThe turmoil makes it clearer than ever that the energy trader's problems we=\nren't solved by the recent departure of Chief Executive Jeffrey Skilling.=\n=20\n\n\nAES Says Indian State Interfering In Ops, Complains To PM\n\n10/23/2001\nDow Jones International News\n(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)\nNEW DELHI (AP)--After Enron Corp. it is the turn of U.S.-based AES Corp. to=\n seek the Indian prime minister's help to settle its grievances with a stat=\ne government.=20\nIn a letter to Atal Bihari Vajpayee, AES Corp.'s President Dennis W.

But gasification combined cycle technology converts coal to a gaseous fuel from which most of the impurities are removed prior to combustion. \nSupporters of coal say the clean coal technology can address many of the environmental concerns of burning coal. \nCoal mining in Britain has been in decline for decades, but the fuel still accounts for about a third of its power generation and recent signs point to the industry enjoying a mini revival. \nA doubling in the price of British natural gas over the last year has led to a rise in coal demand as electricity generators seek out the cheapest fuel in a highly competitive market. The increased demand for coal has propelled prices to about 35 pounds a tonne compared with 22.50 #18 months ago.\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

(AP) - Enron will not be a partner in a proposed natural gas power plant here, the project's managing director said Thursday. \nBut Gary Marcus, who owns Coburg Power, said losing the Texas-based conglomerate will not stop the project.\n\"Enron never drove this deal,\" he said. \"I invited Enron into the deal.\" \nMarcus said Enron's participation improved the quality of the plant's design but slowed the decision-making process. Marcus predicted he will find a new backer in less than six months and will have a license to build the project within a year. \nEnron backed out because the project did not meet its market strategy, Marcus said. \nEnron officials couldn't be reached for comment. \nEnron's departure will do little to appease local residents, who fear that the power plant will harm ground water and air quality. \n\"I don't think it'll ever be built,\" said Kent Johnston of Coburg, a project opponent. \"If the people of Coburg and Eugene have anything to say about it, it won't be.\" \nAdded Joey Gayles, a committee chairman in the residents' opposition group, \"We're going to fight (Marcus) tooth and nail.\" \nThe proposed 40-acre site north of Coburg meets all criteria for construction of a 300-megawatt plant on 12 acres of the site, Marcus said. The remainder of the site would be used for buffer area and wetlands mitigation. \nAn additional eight acres will be required for the 600-megawatt plant that Coburg Power wants to build, he said. The larger plant would require additional permits that might delay the project. \nExpanding the existing natural gas pipeline that runs under the site also would add to the plant's cost. The larger plant would generate the equivalent of all power currently consumed in Lane County. \nMarcus estimated the cost of the larger plant at $300 million to $400 million. The smaller plant would cost about $180 million, he said.\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Business Line (The Hindu) Copyright (C) 2001 Kasturi & Sons Ltd. All Rights Res'd\n\nNEW DELHI, Oct. 11 ENRON is looking at a price of about $30 million for exiting from Greenfield Shipping Company, in which one of its affiliates, Atlantic Commercial Inc, is a 20 per cent equity partner. \nWhile Enron's 20 per cent stake in the $220-million LNG venture for Dabhol Power Company comes to $11 million, the Houston-based company is understood to have put up a price of $30 million for exiting from Greenfield, bankers familiar with the developments told Business Line.\nThe $30 million price pegged by Enron for its 20 per cent stake comprises $11 million for equity and $19 million for swapping the company's share of the loan liabilities, the sources said. \nThough Atlantic Commercial Inc is yet to make an official statement on pulling out of the LNG shipping deal, it is understood to have conveyed to the project lenders led by ANZ Investment Bank that such a decision was imminent in view of Enron's plan to exit from Dabhol Power Company. \nThe State-run Shipping Corporation of India (SCI) is a 20 per cent partner in Greenfield, while the remaining 60 per cent equity in the joint venture consortium is held by Japan's Mitsui O.S.K.Lines. \nIn view of the controversy surrounding the power plant, the lenders to the LNG shipping deal have declared an event of default and suspended the last tranche of the project loan worth $55 million. The ANZ Investment Bank-led consortium has already pumped in $110 million out of a total loan commitment of $165 million for the 137,000 cubic metre capacity tanker being build at Mitsubishi's yard in Japan. \nThe three promoters will now have to put in additional investments to the tune of $55 million to take possession of the vessel on the scheduled delivery date of November 15. \nThe board of SCI has not been able to come to a conclusion on putting in extra funds in the project despite discussing the issue several times. A board meet held on Tuesday to discuss the issue again ended in stalemate, Government sources said. \nSCI's dilemma on making extra investments in the project also centre around the fate of Enron's equity in the deal. In the event of Enron pulling out of the LNG shipping project, its 20 per cent equity would have to be taken over by the two remaining partners. Besides, these two partners would also have to pool-in the additional investments of $55 million amongst themselves in proportion to their revised equity holdings. \n\"However, there is a great question mark over whether Mitsui and SCI should agree to take over the equity of Enron\", the sources said. \nDuring discussions held in London recently, Mitsui had clearly told the lenders that it was not in favour of putting in extra funds to salvage the LNG shipping deal. \nMoreover, with the consortium now looking at a charter hire rate of $60,000 to $65,000 per day as against the rate of $98,600 per day agreed with Dabhol Power Company, both SCI and Mitsui feels that the revised charter hire rates would render their investments unviable. \nAccording to estimates, at a charter hire rate of $60,000 per day, Greenfield is expected to earn about $22 million per annum. Out of this, $4-$5 million will be spent on operating expenses of the tanker. \nThe remaining $17-18 million will fetch an internal rate of return (IRR) of 7-8 per cent for Mitsui at an equity stake of 60 per cent. \n\"Mitsui feels that an IRR of this level was not sufficient for their investments\", the sources said. \nWhereas, for SCI, the investments would fetch a return of 4-4.5 per cent. \"This will be far below the Government norm of 12 per cent IRR for projects involving State-funding,\" the sources said. \nP.

All Rights Res'd\n\nMUMBAI, Oct. 11 THE Commercial Court of London has given an ex parte order restraining the Maharashtra Government from filing a suit in India challenging the international arbitration proceedings initiated by Dabhol Power Company (DPC). \nThe Enron-promoted DPC obtained the order today and the State has 23 days to respond. Maharashtra has been restrained from \"commencing or prosecuting or continuing or taking any steps in or otherwise participating in proceedings in any court or tribunal in India in restraint of or otherwise relating to the three arbitrations\", the order said. The three arbitrations relate to State guarantees to the project.\nA DPC spokesman said now \"the arbitration process in London would continue as originally contemplated and agreed by the State Government and DPC. This has no bearing on the on-going proceedings involving DPC, MSEB and MERC before the Mumbai High Court and Supreme Court\". \nHe also said Maharashtra is not a party to any of the on-going proceedings before the Mumbai High Court and the Supreme Court. \"Over the past few months, the State Government and other Government entities have taken actions to avoid complying with their contractual obligations. \nThis has frustrated the rights of international investors that were legally agreed to by the relevant parties several years ago. The injunction facilitates the timely and impartial review by the international arbitration panel of the dispute between DPC and the State,\" the company said. \nThe arbitration panel had been constituted sometime ago and proceedings were expected to begin any time. \nHowever, the proceedings could not take off as a dispute over the jurisdiction of the Maharashtra State Electricity Regulatory Commission had dragged on to the Mumbai High Court and then the Supreme Court. \nBoth courts had restrained DPC from continuing international arbitration pending resolution of the MERC jurisdiction issue. The State Government was expected to file a civil suit in the Mumbai High Court accusing the company of fraud and misrepresentation. Internal differences in the Government and the legal team over proving \"fraud\" had led to the resignation of the State counsel. \nOur Bureau\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

                "Content": " JARNOLD (Non-Privileged).pst\n\nWelcome to Enron Center South. As you have probably already noticed, things look a little different here. We wanted to orientate you to your new environment and inform you about the future technology coming on-line in the coming weeks. \n\nOccupancy Guidebook To Enron Center South\nYou will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concerning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and telephony procedures.\n\nNEC Monitors\nThe NEC monitors have an internal anti-glare screen to help reduce eye strain and eliminate the need to install an additional screen cover.  Additionally, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk.\n\nTurret Users\nAn \"Alliance MX turret quick reference guide\" has been placed on your desk; this includes important information about the new features such as \"Caller ID\" and \"Voicemail Indication\".\n\nIncreased Information Access\nThere are many NEC 50\" Plasma screens installed on the 5th and 6th floors.  While many of these will be displaying information designed for the specific unit, others will be displaying various television channels.  The audio to these television channels can be accessed via any of your telephony equipment.  Here's how:\n\nTen audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret.  The channels have been defined on Page 15 of your Turret.  To access the audio from either your Avaya or Stentophon, simply dial the extensions shown in the table below:\n \nChannel\tAvaya\tStentophon\t\nWeather Channel\t12401\t801\t\nCNN Headlines News\t12402\t802\t\nCNN Financial News\t12403\t803\t\nCNBC\t12404\t804\t\nMSNBC\t12405\t805\t\nBloomberg\t12406\t806\t\nFinancial News Network\t12407\t807\t\nCNN\t12408\t808\t\nFox Sports\t12409\t809\t\nESPN1\t12410\t810\t\n\n\nWireless Telephony\nYou may notice the cellular phone coverage is not consistent across the floor, and some areas have virtually no coverage at all.  We are implementing a multi-network \"in-building\" system to provide consistent high quality service for the campus, keeping you in touch while you are on the move.  \n\nWireless LAN\nThe infrastructure to support Wireless LAN technology is in place and is being tested. We will be implementing multi level encryption and security to keep our intellectual property safe from eavesdroppers or hackers.\n\nAmtel Replacement\nAs a move to provide a more flexible \"Plug n Play\" environment and to help with the reduced desk footprint, we have replaced the Amtel message boxes with Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging. The Global Messaging Team is testing additional software products to provide some of the features not available with Exchange Instant Messaging; these include one-touch response keys, external LED display, and printing.  Updates will be provided as they become available.\n\nKeeping an Open forum\nWe will keep you informed of the changes and developments as the migration to the building continues, please feel free to respond with any comments, queries or suggestions to  mailto:Enron.Center.South.Technology@enron.com"

I hope all of you have been watching=\n your food intake like  I have, because I certainly intend to eat my fair s=\nhare of the Thanksgiving  feast!!!  And that brings me to the most asked qu=\nestion from last weekend,  \"Hey, Christopher, with all this great wine, wha=\nt will YOU be drinking on  Thanksgiving?\"  Before I reveal my T-day sampler=\n case, I wanted to let you  know what types of food we will pairing these w=\nines with.  We usually start  with some type of shellfish, some mild, some =\nspicy.  For my family and  friends who don't do shellfish, we also offer so=\nme traditional stuff such as the  best stuffed eggs I have ever tasted (tha=\nnks to Martha, don't you know), and  assorted cheeses and crackers.  Then c=\nomes the main course: TUR-DUC-KEN  (always from our friends at La Boucherie=\n), with all the 'fixins': jalepeno  cornbread stuffing, traditional stuffin=\ng with sage, and a pile of different  veggies.  Naturally, dessert is prepa=\nred, but we usually stick to pretty  simple, fairly tame ones, like pumpkin=\n pie or pumpkin something.  This is  where the Riesling from the sampler ca=\nse comes in.  It is also amazing with  the shellfish.  To make this meal a =\nsmashing success, I have selected the  following sampler case of 12 bottles=\n:\n\nCHRISTOPHER'S PERSONAL THANKSGIVING  SAMPLER (2 BTLS EACH): =20\n\nBaron Foulon Sauvignon Blanc 2000 =20\n                (classic  Sauvignon Blanc, very similar to expensive Sancer=\nre) 87 points =20\nEstate GH von Mumm Rheingau Dry Riesling 1999 =20\n\n                (FABULOUS,  semi-dry Riesling, like a crisp red apple) 88 p=\noints =20\nChateau LaCroix Martelle Minervois 1999 =20\n\n                (you  may remember this, my house red, serious Syrah) 89 po=\nints =20\nDomaine Capouilleres Ventoux 1998 =20\n\n                (so  full of blue fruits, loves the spicy stuff) 87 points =\n=20\nDomaine du Pain de Sucre Pinot Noir 1997 =20\n\n                (packed  with the most amazing Pinot fruit, tastes like a $=\n35 Burgundy) 88 points =20\nLes Magnans Vacqueyras 1998 =20\n\n                (from  our current web-site newsletter, serious Grenache, t=\nhink Chateauneuf-du-Pape) 88  points\nTo make your gathering extra special, I have decided to offer this  high-qu=\nality sampler at a price you will never see again!!!\nNormally, this  case would run close to 200 bucks!!!\nTHIS WEEK,  ONLY, ENJOY THE SPECIAL HOLIDAY PRICE OF: $163 PLUS TAX,  EACH\nPlease call us as soon as you are able, I have only a  couple of dozen of t=\nhese special cases available.\nHave your card number ready  and call me at 713-524-9144 to order. =20\n\"Christopher, I know I saw  the subject above.

Once signed into ussoccerfan.com, participants can join the chat by selecting \"Live Chat\" under \"Interact\" on the ussoccerfan.com navigation menu.\n\nThe 2001 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup Final will crown a new champion on Saturday, October 27, at Titan Stadium in Fullerton, Calif. The championship final will be televised live at 2 p.m. PT (5 p.m. ET) on Fox Sports World and Fox Sports World Espa?ol.\n\nClavijo, 45, became the head coach of the New England Revolution before the 2000 season, guiding the team to its most successful season ever and leading the side to its first-ever playoff victory during the 2000 season. Clavijo had a stellar career as a player for both club and country, earning 61 caps with the United States. A part of the World Cup roster in 1994, he started and played the full 90 minutes in the USA's historic 2-1 win against Colombia. A 12-time All-Star, he was named the player of the 80's for the Major Indoor Soccer League.\n\nDating back to 1914, the 88-year-old U.S. Open Cup is the oldest soccer cup competition in the United States and is among the oldest in the world.  In Saturday's match, the Galaxy will play in their third championship game of the year having previously claimed the CONCACAF Championship in January before losing 2-1 in overtime to the San Jose Earthquakes in the 2001 MLS Cup. Los Angeles is the first U.S. team to play in a Regional Championship, a Division I Championship and the U.S. Open Cup Final in the same calendar year.  The New England Revolution, after going winless in two previous tournament appearances, will now play their first-ever tournament final in club history.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTo end your membership in ussoccerfan.com, please visit http://membership.ussoccer.com/member/unsubscribe.sps?msmid=1 and fill out an unsubscribe request.

It helps us discuss it internally.\n\nRecently our internal compliance folks have discussed the \"give-up risk\".\nSpecifically, what guarantee do we have that the executor's (Enron) FCM will\naccept the block trade and get it to the exchange on behalf of our clients?\nThere is some concern that there might be limits imposed by the FCM due to\nissues such as credit and the high volatility of NG.\n\nThey have requested we sign a four (or more) party give-up agreement between\nCampbell, Enron, your clearing firm(s) and our clearing firm(s).  Is this\nthe SOP as you envision the NYMEX EFS?  We are at the point where the\nspecific documentation issues are the main obstacles to moving forward.  If\nwe buy 1,000 NG from you, how do we know your FCM can guarantee acceptance\nof the trade for further give-up?  Your legal feedback is welcome.\n\nThanks,\nCDY\n\n\n========================================================\n\nThe information transmitted in this email is intended for the named\naddressee(s) only.

Officials from the New York City Mayor's Office for Economic Development as well as NYBOT and Standard & Poor's presided over the launch.\n\nStandard & Poor's, a leading provider of global financial information and investment analysis, and the New York Board of Trade, a global marketplace for alternative investment products, developed the SPCI to bring greater definition to traded commodities as an investable asset class. The SPCI was introduced at a ceremony at NYBOT on August 9, 2001. The SPCI futures and options allow managers and investors to add real diversification to their portfolios through a single, transparent access point to the investment opportunities found in commodity futures markets. \n\n\"The launch of this new product so soon after the events of September 11, and on a trading floor so imaginatively developed before the event, allowing NYBOT to start trading so soon after the loss of its facility in lower Manhattan, is a testament to the strength and the resilience of New Yorkers,\" said Michael G. Carey, President, New York City Economic Development Corporation. \"Let no one doubt that New York is and continues to be the financial and trading capital of the world.\"\n\n\"To contribute successfully to long-term portfolio goals, an alternative asset should have certain key characteristics, namely a proper benchmark, transparency, liquidity, simplicity, cost efficiency and flexible trading capabilities,\" said NYBOT President and CEO Mark D. Fichtel. \"SPCI futures and options are among the few investment instruments that meet all the criteria for a real alternative asset. We believe that these new contracts will prove particularly valuable to investors and managers who need alternative investment strategies in these difficult economic times.\"\n\nThe NYBOT SPCI futures contract lists six active contract months (January, February, April, June, August, November). Expiration is the second Friday of the listed futures contract month, and the contract is cash settled. The futures contract is valued at $100 x the Index (current contract value approximately $100,000). Trading hours initially will be 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM (New York Time). Options on futures are also offered (see contract specifications). \n\n\"SPCI futures and options give investors a direct means to obtain exposure to a diversified commodity basket,\" said Robert Shakotko, Standard & Poor's Managing Director of Index Services. \"Investors around the world recognize the S&P reputation for equity indices and index products. We now bring these same business strengths to commodities.\" \n\nThe SPCI tracks 17 commodities in six sectors including grains, meat and livestock, metals, softs (coffee, sugar, cocoa), fibers, and energy. The index utilizes real-time prices of the relevant futures contracts traded on the commodities futures markets in New York and Chicago. Key features of the SPCI include its geometric calculation methodology and a weighting adjustment that eliminates double counting of upstream and downstream commodities. \n\nThe new SPCI futures and options contracts will support and enhance other index-linked investment products. They offer an easy and efficient way to manage commodity index funds, commodity-linked insurance products, or commodity exposure in multi-asset products. As with its equity indices, Standard & Poor's has initiated a licensing program for the SPCI directed at financial institutions that might use the new commodity index as part of an innovative investment product.\n\nEnd-of-day index values and index history are available through both the S&P Index Services website at www.spglobal.com <http://www.spglobal.com/indexmaincommodity.html> and NYBOT's Website at www.nybot.com <http://www.nybot.com/>. The SPCI is calculated every 15 seconds and is available through traditional real-time quote vendors via the NYBOT; the ticker symbol will be 'I'. \n\nStandard & Poor's, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies (NYSE: MHP), provides independent financial information, analytical services, and credit ratings to the world's financial markets. Among the company's many products are the S&P Global 1200, the first real-time, global equity index, the S&P 500, the premier U.S. portfolio index, and credit ratings on more than 220,000 securities and funds worldwide.

(CSCE) and the New York Cotton Exchange (NYCE). Through its two exchanges and their subsidiaries and divisions NYBOT offers an expanding range of agricultural, currency and index products.

Emshwiller\nStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal\n\n10/23/2001\nThe Wall Street Journal\nA3\n(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)\n\nEnron Corp. said it has been contacted by the Securities and Exchange Commi=\nssion seeking information on the energy giant's controversial dealings with=\n partnerships that were set up and run until recently by its chief financia=\nl officer, Andrew S. Fastow.=20\nFollowing Enron's announcement yesterday morning of the SEC inquiry, the co=\nmpany's stock took another big slide, falling more than 20% in New York Sto=\nck Exchange trading. As of 4 p.m., Enron shares were trading at $20.65, off=\n $5.40, knocking about $4 billion off Enron's market capitalization. Volume=\n topped the Big Board's most-active list at about 36 million shares. A week=\n ago, Enron stock was trading at about $33 a share. Subsequently, the compa=\nny announced a $1.01 billion third-quarter write-off that produced a $618 m=\nillion loss.\nAnalysts also voiced concerns yesterday about possible other bad news lurki=\nng amid Enron's vast and extremely complex operations. The company has deal=\nings with a number of related entities. Under certain circumstances, if Enr=\non's credit rating and stock price fall far enough, the company would be ob=\nligated to issue tens of millions of additional shares to these entities, d=\niluting the holdings of current shareholders.=20\nEnron has previously acknowledged the provisions but said its business is s=\ntrong and it feels confident that there will be no defaults.=20\nIn a statement, Enron Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay said the com=\npany \"will cooperate fully\" with the SEC inquiry and \"look(s) forward to th=\ne opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to rest.\" Enron h=\nas consistently said that it believes its dealings with the Fastow-related =\npartnerships were proper and properly disclosed. The company has said it pu=\nt billions of dollars of assets and stock into partnership-related transact=\nions as a way to hedge against fluctuating market conditions.=20\nThe SEC inquiry came from the agency's Fort Worth, Texas, regional office. =\nAccording to a person familiar with the matter, this would indicate that th=\ne inquiry comes from the SEC's enforcement arm, as opposed to its corporate=\n-finance section. The participation of the enforcement branch would indicat=\ne that the agency is looking into whether there were possible violations of=\n securities law. However, enforcement-branch inquiries often don't produce =\nany allegations of wrongdoing. It also appears that the SEC hasn't yet take=\nn the step of launching a formal investigation, which would be a sign that =\nthe agency believes securities laws might have been violated. The SEC decli=\nned to comment.=20\nCertainly, there have been questions and concerns about those partnership t=\nransactions, which contributed to a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder e=\nquity last week as part of Enron's efforts to unwind the deals. Mr. Fastow,=\n who has declined repeated interview requests, resigned from the partnershi=\nps, known as LJM Cayman LP and LJM2 Co-Investment LP, in late July in the f=\nace of rising conflict-of-interest concerns by Wall Street analysts and maj=\nor company investors.=20\nSince then, internal partnership documents have shown that Mr. Fastow and p=\nerhaps a handful of Enron associates made millions of dollars last year in =\nfees and capital increases as general partner of the LJM2, the larger of th=\ne two partnerships.=20\nMr. Fastow's partnership arrangement caused some unhappiness inside Enron, =\naccording to people familiar with the matter. For instance, these people sa=\ny, sometime after the creation of the partnerships in 1999, Enron Treasurer=\n Jeffrey McMahon went to company president Jeffrey Skilling and complained =\nabout potential conflicts of interest posed by Mr. Fastow's activities. Mr.=\n Skilling didn't share Mr. McMahon's concern, these people say, and Mr. McM=\nahon requested and received reassignment to another post.=20\nMr. Skilling resigned as Enron president and chief executive in mid-August,=\n citing personal reasons and the fall in Enron's stock price, which peaked =\nat about $90 a share last year. Mr. McMahon and Mr. Skilling haven't respon=\nded to repeated interview requests.=20\nInvestors are also concerned about potential problems arising in Enron's de=\nalings with other related entities. In some cases, Enron could be required =\nto issue large amounts of stock to noteholders in some of the entities if c=\nertain so-called double trigger provisions occur.=20\nFor example, last July Enron helped create the Marlin Water Trust II, which=\n sold $915 million in notes that are due July 15, 2003. However, Enron can =\nbe considered in default, in advance of that date, if its stock price falls=\n below $34.13 for three trading days and its senior debt is downgraded to b=\nelow investment grade by either Moody's Investors Service or Standard & Poo=\nr's.=20\nCurrently, Enron debt is still investment-grade at both ratings agencies an=\nd would have to be lowered by several notches to fall into a noninvestment =\ngrade category. Last week, Moody's put Enron on review for a possible downg=\nrade. However, observers believe that even if Moody's lowers Enron's rating=\n, the company will still be investment-grade.\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. =09\n\nOctober 23, 2001\nWhere Did the Value Go at Enron?\nBy FLOYD NORRIS\nNew York Times\nWhat really went on in some of the most opaque transactions with insiders e=\nver seen?\nWall Street has been puzzling over that since Enron (news/quote </redirect/=\nmarketwatch/redirect.ctx?MW=3Dhttp://custom.marketwatch.com/custom/nyt-com/=\nhtml-companyprofile.asp&symb=3DENE>) released its quarterly earnings a week=\n ago. Yesterday shares in Enron plunged $5.40, to $20.65, after the company=\n said that the Securities and Exchange Commission was looking into the tran=\nsactions.\nThe reaction was in some ways puzzling. Given the questions that have been =\nraised since the earnings announcement - some of them prominently featured =\nin The Wall Street Journal - it was likely that the S.E.C. would begin a pr=\neliminary inquiry.\nWhether it will go farther than that is not clear, but if nothing else the =\nslide in Enron shares over the last week shows the hazards that can confron=\nt a company that allows word of a major reduction in its balance sheet valu=\ne to dribble out. Enron's shares rose 67 cents, to $33.84, last Tuesday, as=\n investors first reacted to the earnings announcement. But since then they =\nhave fallen $13.19, or 39 percent.\nThe $1.2 billion reduction in shareholders' equity was not mentioned in a n=\news release Enron issued on its quarterly earnings last Tuesday. It was bri=\nefly mentioned in a conference call with analysts, but many of the listener=\ns seem to have not noticed that, wrongly thinking Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's c=\nhairman and chief executive, was referring to a $1 billion write-off that w=\nas disclosed in the earnings release.\nWhen questions were asked in the following days, the explanations were less=\n than thorough. Enron explained that the reduction in shareholders' equity =\nwas related to the termination of \"structured finance vehicles\" involving p=\nartnerships that had been controlled by the company's chief financial offic=\ner.\n\"Both the debt and the equity people are looking for more clarity about how=\n the company goes about its business,\" said Ralph Pellecchia, a credit anal=\nyst at Fitch Investors Service. He added that the issue of the company's \"c=\nredibility related to this transaction really seems to have a life of its o=\nwn.\"\nEnron declined yesterday to allow any officials to be interviewed about its=\n financial reports. But last night it said Mr. Lay would hold another confe=\nrence call with investors at 9:30 a.m. today.=20\nThe company's earlier disclosures regarding the partnerships baffled many a=\nnalysts. They referred to such things as \"share settled costless collar arr=\nangements\" and \"derivative instruments which eliminated the contingent natu=\nre of existing restricted forward contracts.\" The disclosures said the comp=\nany entered into the transactions \"to hedge certain merchant investments an=\nd other assets.\"\nIt appears that Enron was able to report profits from them, even though the=\n underlying assets included investments that declined in value. The Wall St=\nreet Journal, citing reports the partnerships made to institutional investo=\nrs, has reported the partnerships did well enough to make large cash distri=\nbutions to their investors. Enron officials in recent days have refused to =\ndiscuss the arrangements in any detail.\nOne of the questions that the S.E.C. may look into is whether the terminati=\non of those transactions should have been treated as a balance sheet item, =\nor whether it should have been taken as a loss that affected reported earni=\nngs. An S.E.C. spokesman declined to comment.\nUnder accounting rules, a company's transactions in its own shares cannot p=\nroduce profits or losses, whatever the effect on cash flow. So a company th=\nat sells its shares for $10 each, and buys them back at $50, or at $1, will=\n report no earnings effect. Enron said that the reduction to shareholders e=\nquity, and a related reduction in notes receivable, \"is the result of Enron=\n's termination of previously recorded contractual obligations to deliver En=\nron shares in future periods.\"\nStephen Moore, an analyst with Moody's Investors Service who has put Enron'=\ns debt on review for a possible downgrade, said that while some of the deta=\nils were not clear, \"Essentially, Enron's promise was that a certain amount=\n of Enron's shares would be worth $1 billion. The shares plummeted, and the=\ny were not\" worth that much.\nEnron emphasizes its own version of earnings, which leaves out some expense=\ns, and directs attention away from its balance sheet, which is disclosed on=\nly in S.E.C. filings, not in the earnings news release. The reduction in sh=\nareholders' equity would be shown only on the third-quarter balance sheet, =\nwhich has yet to be released.\nEarlier this year, Jeffrey Skilling, then Enron's chief executive, reacted =\nstrongly when a questioner on a conference call challenged the failure to p=\nrovide balance sheet numbers when earnings were released. He called the que=\nstioner a common vulgarity that surprised many listeners. Mr. Skilling late=\nr resigned for what he said were personal reasons and Mr. Lay, the chairman=\n and former chief executive, took back the latter title.\nWhile Enron was riding high, its often difficult-to-understand reports were=\n generally seen as not being a problem. The company appeared to be the domi=\nnant force in the business of energy trading, and to be able to produce phe=\nnomenal profits. When Mr. Lay was reported as having played an important ro=\nle in formulating the Bush administration's energy policies, the aura was o=\nnly enhanced. In January, the shares traded for $84.\nBut now, with some of the company's ventures clearly having run into proble=\nms, it appears that investors are growing less willing to accept the compan=\ny's reports. That the partnership transactions were disclosed at all was be=\ncause of the involvement of the chief financial officer, and some have wond=\nered if there might have been similar deals with others.\nMr. Lay has promised to make the company's financial reports easier to unde=\nrstand, and last week's report was at first praised by some analysts for do=\ning just that.\nIn a news release yesterday, Mr. Lay said the company welcomed the S.E.C.'s=\n request for information. \"We will cooperate fully with the S.E.C. and look=\n forward to the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to =\nrest,\" he said.\n\nFRONT PAGE - FIRST SECTION: SEC probes Enron over financial dealings=20\nFinancial Times; Oct 23, 2001\nBy JULIE EARLE, JOHN LABATE and SHEILA MCNULTY\n\nEnron, the US energy giant, disclosed yesterday that the Securities and Exc=\nhange Commission had asked it to provide financial information at the start=\n of an informal inquiry.=20\nThe announcement follows a rapid sell-off in the stock in reaction to Enron=\n's surprise revelation last week of a Dollars 1.2bn charge to equity to eli=\nminate the dilutive effects of closing one of its controversial financing v=\nehicles.=20\nIn revealing the SEC call for more detailed information \"regarding certain =\nrelated party transactions\", Enron hopes to counter growing criticism that =\nit should be more transparent. \"We welcome this request,\" said Kenneth Lay,=\n Enron chairman and chief executive officer. \"We will co-operate fully with=\n the SEC and look forward to the opportunity to put any concern about these=\n transactions to rest.\"=20\nThe SEC probe into Enron's financial dealings is an informal one at this st=\nage, according to the company, and the request for documents is voluntary. =\nHowever, SEC probes often begin lightly as investigators gather information=\n on an issue.=20\nSuch a probe could turn into a formal investigation at any time. In that ca=\nse, regulators would be armed with subpoena powers and could demand certain=\n documents be handed over. The SEC would not confirm or deny the existence =\nof the Enron probe.=20\nMr Lay did not say which transactions the SEC was reviewing, although analy=\nsts believe they relate to Andrew Fastow, Enron chief financial officer, wh=\no has been reported to have run a limited partnership that bought assets va=\nlued at hundreds of millions of dollars from Enron.=20\nAnalysts say the transactions, while controversial because of Mr Fastow's l=\ninks to the company, have been disclosed. What concerns them, however, is h=\now Enron valued the assets involved. www.ft.com/energy=20\nCopyright: The Financial Times Limited\n\nCOMPANIES & FINANCE THE AMERICAS: Group full of surprises after failing to =\nopen up=20\nFinancial Times; Oct 23, 2001\nBy SHEILA MCNULTY\n\nRonald Barone joked he would have to get plenty of rest ahead of Enron's re=\nsults last week, noting the US energy company's reputation for producing wh=\nat some analysts say is the most complicated of earnings reports.=20\nThe UBS Warburg analyst was, nevertheless, as ill-prepared as his peers for=\n the announcement of a Dollars 1.2bn charge to equity to eliminate the dilu=\ntive effects of closing one of its controversial financing vehicles.=20\nThe news overshadowed Enron's on-target 26 per cent increase in third-quart=\ner earnings per share, sending the stock plunging.=20\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission's subsequent request for more inform=\nation about Enron's financial activities has reinforced analyst perceptions=\n that the company should have been more transparent in its reporting.=20\nCurt Launer, of Credit Suisse First Boston, says expectations for more disc=\nlosure had built up over the past two months. Kenneth Lay, Enron chairman, =\nhad promised to be more forthcoming when he resumed the duties of chief exe=\ncutive following the resignation of Jeff Skilling in August.=20\nWhile Mr Lay did improve Enron's disclosure by creating headings for new bu=\nsiness segments and providing more detail within each of them, the Dollars =\n1.2bn charge still caught the market off guard.=20\n\"It came as a surprise to us,\" said Stephen Moore, of Moody's Investors Ser=\nvice. \"We should have been informed that it was there.\"=20\nMr Barone found it disturbing that Enron disclosed the charge in \"a fleetin=\ng comment\" during its conference call with analysts and did not mention it =\nin its nine-page news release.=20\n\"Despite progress in other areas, there appears to be much more work ahead =\nbefore the lingering credibility issues that have vexed this company in the=\n past are fully resolved,\" he said.=20\nEnron contends that \"we did disclose it in the conference call, and it was =\none of the first points raised in the Q and A session (on the conference ca=\nll)\".=20\nMr Lay has pledged to co-operate with the SEC's request, which appears to b=\ne part of an informal inquiry rather than an official investigation.

Lay, chairman and chief executive of the Houston-based =\ncompany.\nBut the announcement jarred investors' confidence in the giant energy-tradi=\nng company, already hurt by the unexpected resignation of chief executive J=\neffrey K. Skilling in August, and heavy losses from investments in broadban=\nd Internet and other technology ventures.\n\"A lot of people threw in the towel today,\" said Anatol Feygin, an analyst =\nwith J.P. Morgan in New York.\nThe SEC request was made privately last Wednesday, the day after Enron repo=\nrted a $1 billion write-off of investment losses and restructuring charges =\nfrom unsuccessful technology ventures and other operations. The write-offs =\nleft Enron with a $618 million loss in the third quarter (84 cents a share)=\n.\nThe Wall Street Journal reported last week that $35 million of the write-of=\nf was tied to losses at limited partnerships established by Enron's chief f=\ninancial officer, Andrew Fastow, and run by him until July.\nEnron told investment analysts last week that it had repurchased 55 million=\n shares of its stock held by the partnerships that Fastow had directed, red=\nucing shareholder equity by $1.2 billion.\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, Fastow set up several investment part=\nnerships with the approval of Enron's board. The partnerships engaged in bi=\nllions of dollars in complex financial transactions involving Enron and mad=\ne major investments in power plants and other assets alongside Enron.\nAn Enron shareholder has filed suit in Texas state court alleging that Enro=\nn's board violated its duty to the company by permitting the chief financia=\nl officer to engage in the outside transactions that allegedly earned milli=\nons of dollars in fees for himself and other investors in the partnerships.=\n What Enron received from the relationships is not clear.\nFeygin said that the company had informed analysts about the limited partne=\nrships, which offered Enron a way to take positions in strategic but uncert=\nain technology ventures without detailing the outcomes in its public financ=\nial statements.=20\n\"In hindsight, that was an error in judgment. I don't think it was an error=\n in principle,\" the analyst said.\nEnron could have revealed the SEC inquiry last week but did not disclose it=\n until yesterday, and for many investors, that was the last straw, Feygin s=\naid.\nThe stock closed yesterday at $20.65, down $5.40, as 36 million shares chan=\nged hands.\nStaff researcher Richard Drezen contributed to this report.\n\n\nEnron Suffers After Unclear Disclosure, New York Times Says\n2001-10-23 06:31 (New York)\n\n\n     Houston, Oct. 23 (Bloomberg) -- The U.S. Securities and\nExchange Commission's decision to look into some Enron Corp.\ntransactions and the company's recent decline in value show what\ncan happen when a company lets a major reduction in its balance\nsheet dribble out, Floyd Norris of the New York Times reported in\nhis column, citing analysts.\n\n     Investors are concerned as to how Enron reduced shareholders'\nequity by $1.2 billion and why this was not mentioned in a news\nrelease the company issued with its quarterly earnings last\nTuesday, the paper said.\n\n     Enron Corp.'s shares fell 21 percent yesterday after the\nHouston-based company said the Securities and Exchange Commission\nrequested information on partnerships run by Chief Financial\nOfficer Andrew Fastow and other executives.

Skilling and Andrew Fastow. The Honorable Melinda Harmon is the Judge pre=\nsiding over the case.\nThe Complaint alleges that defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of =\nthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder,=\n by issuing a series of material misrepresentations to the market between J=\nanuary 18, 2000 and October 17, 2001, thereby artificially inflating the pr=\nice of Enron common stock. Specifically, the complaint alleges that Enron i=\nssued a series of statements concerning its business, financial results and=\n operations which failed to disclose (i) that the Company's Broadband Servi=\nces Division was experiencing declining demand for bandwidth and the Compan=\ny's efforts to create a trading market for bandwidth were not meeting with =\nsuccess as many of the market participants were not creditworthy; (ii) that=\n the Company's operating results were materially overstated as result of th=\ne Company failing to timely write-down the value of its investments with ce=\nrtain limited partnerships which were managed by the Company's chief financ=\nial officer; and (iii) that Enron was failing to write-down impaired assets=\n on a timely basis in accordance with GAAP.

Subsequently,=\n Enron revealed that a material portion of the charge related to the unwind=\ning of investments with certain limited partnerships which were controlled =\nby Enron's chief financial officer and that the Company would be eliminatin=\ng more than $1 billion in shareholder equity as a result of its unwinding o=\nf the investments. As this news began to be assimilated by the market, the =\nprice of Enron common stock dropped significantly.

A Janus spokeswoman wasn't immediately\navailable to comment.\n\n     Morningstar's Benz said she suspects Janus fund managers have\nalready begun trimming their Enron positions.\n\n     Enron shares had fallen 59 percent this year before last\nweek's news on concerns about financial reporting and money-losing\ninvestments outside energy trading, such as trading space on\nbroadband telecommunications networks and building water treatment\nplants.\n\n     The stock fell $5.40, or 21 percent, to $20.65 in New York\ntrading today.\n\n     ``Anecdotal evidence that I'm hearing from the fund managers\nthere is that they had been trimming pretty aggressively,'' said\nBenz. She added that it's ``difficult to make the assertion that\nthey are in the clear.''\n\n     Janus Capital is owned by Kansas City, Missouri-based\nStilwell Financial Inc., whose shares gained 73 cents today to\n$22.52. Stilwell shares have fallen 43 percent this year.\n\n\nEnron Says SEC Asks About Related-Party Transactions (Update9)\n2001-10-22 18:30 (New York)\n\nEnron Says SEC Asks About Related-Party Transactions (Update9)\n\n     (Adds information on conference call in 26th paragraph.)\n\n     Houston, Oct. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s shares fell 21\npercent after the Houston-based company said the Securities and\nExchange Commission requested information on partnerships run by\nChief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow and other executives.\n\n     Enron, the largest energy trader, created partnerships and\nother affiliated companies to buy and sell assets such as power\nplants to lower the debt on its books. An investor sued Enron's\nboard Wednesday, saying two partnerships cost the company $35\nmillion and Fastow's leadership of them was a conflict of\ninterest.\n\n     Investors today said they were concerned that Enron may be\nforced to dismantle the affiliated companies by paying off the\nowners in cash or stock. Chief Executive Ken Lay said last week he\nmay be have to ``unravel'' agreements that created the companies\nif Enron's debt ratings fall too far.\n\n     ``We need confidence their long-term credit rating won't go\nbelow investment grade,'' said Roger Hamilton, an analyst at John\nHancock's value funds, which own 600,000 Enron shares.\n\n     Enron reduced shareholders' equity by $1.2 billion when it\nrepurchased 55 million shares of two such partnerships controlled\nby Fastow, LJM Cayman and LMJ2 Co-Investment, the Wall Journal\nreported last week.\n\n     Dismantling more of the affiliated companies and partnerships\nwould cost Enron or its shareholders as much as $3 billion, Ray\nNiles, a Salomon Smith Barney analyst, wrote in a report to\ninvestors today.\n\n                           Shares Plunge\n\n     Enron shares fell $5.40 to $20.65. They touched $19.67 during\nthe day's trading, the lowest level since Jan. 15, 1998.\n\n     The stock has fallen 75 percent this year amid concerns about\nfailed investments in trading of space on fiber-optic\ncommunications networks and a water company, and the resignation\nof Jeff Skilling as CEO in August after seven months on the job.\n\n     While Skilling said he resigned for personal reasons,\ninvestors say his departure led them to question whether the\ncompany was concealing problems, including possible liabilities\nfrom affiliated companies.\n\n     On Tuesday, Enron surprised many investors when it reported a\n$618 million third-quarter loss, the result of writing off $1.01\nbillion in failed investments.\n\n     Moody's Investors Service placed the company's debt on watch\nfor possible downgrade. The company's debt is rated at investment\ngrade by Fitch, Standard & Poor's and Moody's.\n\n     The company received a faxed request for information from the\nSEC on Wednesday asking for information, spokesman Mark Palmer\nsaid, and will respond ``as soon as possible.''\n\n     ``We will cooperate fully with the SEC and look forward to\nthe opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to\nrest,'' Lay, who is also Enron's chairman, said in a statement.\n\n                          Dilution Fears\n\n     Enron has formed at least 18 companies to serve as financing\nvehicles for its projects, based on filings with the Texas\nsecretary of state. Fastow and other Enron executives are named as\nthe controlling partners or the board members in the companies.\n\n     Some have bought Enron assets such as power plants, removing\nthe debt for those projects from Enron's books. That allows Enron\nto keep cash earned from the main trading business from supporting\nwhat it views as secondary businesses, Standard & Poor's debt\nanalyst Todd Shipman said.\n\n     Enron brokers trades of electricity, natural gas and other\ncommodities as well as owns power plants and natural-gas\npipelines.\n\n     Dismantling the affiliates would be costly. Whitewing\nManagement, an affiliated company that has bought 14 Enron power\nplants and lists Fastow as managing director, holds 250,000\npreferred shares of Enron.\n\n     Enron may have to convert the preferred shares to common\nstock if share prices fall below a certain level and the credit\nrating drops below investment grade, according to company filings.\nThat would dilute the value of common shareholders' investment.\n\n     ``The concern is how many of these dilutive structures are\nout there?'' Shipman said. ``Investors are worried they might have\nto share their Enron earnings with a lot more people than they\noriginally thought.''\n\n                        Worrisome Financing\n\n     Enron's auditors and attorneys reviewed the company's\n``related party arrangements,'' the board approved them, and they\nwere disclosed in SEC filings, Enron said in its statement.\n\n     That hasn't eased concerns. The reduction of shareholder\nequity by $1.2 billion from the LJM partnerships is reason to\nworry about Enron's other financing vehicles, wrote Niles, the\nSalomon analyst. Enron also may take another $2.4 billion in\nlosses from investments in the Dabhol power plant in India and\nprojects in South America, he wrote.\n\n                            Bonds Fall\n\n     Enron's 8 percent coupon bonds due in 2005 fell $34 per\n$1,000 face value to be offered at $1,022 today from $1,056 on\nFriday, traders said. Yield on the debt rose to 7.33 percent from\n6.33 percent.\n\n     Based on Bloomberg composite ratings, most of Enron's long-\nterm debt is rated at BBB2 and BBB1, two or three levels above\ninvestment grade.\n\n     Fastow continues to work, and Enron hasn't punished him,\nPalmer said. Fastow declined to be interviewed, spokeswoman Karen\nDenne said. SEC spokesman John Heine declined to comment on the\nagency's request to Enron.\n\n     ``We believe everything that needed to be considered and done\nin connection with these transactions was considered and done,''\nLay said in the statement.\n\n     Enron will hold a conference call to discuss investors'\nconcerns at 9:30 a.m. New York time Tuesday. The call may be\naccessed through the ``Investors'' section of Enron's Web site at\nhttp://www.enron.com.\n\n--Russell Hubbard in the Princeton newsroom at 609-750-4651, or at\nrhubbard2@Bloomberg.net and Mark Johnson in the Princeton newsroom\nat (609) 750-4662, or mjohnson7@bloomberg.net, with reporting by\nTerry Flanagan/slb/alp/pjm/slb/*atr/alp/taw\n\n\nTrusts Keeping Enron Off Balance\nBy Peter Eavis <mailto:peavis@thestreet.com>\nSenior Columnist\nTheStreet.com\n10/22/2001 07:15 AM EDT\nURL: <http://www.thestreet.com/markets/detox/10002702.html>\n\nEnron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) stock plunged 20% last week after the =\nenergy giant revealed that a complex financing deal caused a $1.2 billion h=\nit to its equity. But other big deals that have yet to receive much public =\nscrutiny could further damage the company's balance sheet.=20\nIn the spotlight last week were transactions done with investment partnersh=\nips called LJM2 and LJM Cayman. An examination of the LJM2-related equity w=\nritedown can be found here.=20\nHowever, the LJM deals make up only part of Enron's sophisticated financing=\n arrangements. Also at issue are two large trusts that contain assets Enron=\n shifted from its balance sheet. These are the $1 billion Marlin Water Trus=\nt II and the $2.4 billion Osprey Trust, usually known as Whitewing.=20\nThe key risk for investors is how Enron chooses to repay these trusts if th=\ney don't unwind as planned. The company may end up issuing stock to repay m=\noney borrowed through the trusts. This would dilute existing shareholders. =\nAlternatively, Enron could resort to using cash raised through sales of on-=\nbalance sheet assets. But this would hamper efforts to reduce debt and depr=\nive the company's profitable business lines of much-needed capital.=20\nWhitewing and a Prayer?\nThough set up by Enron, Marlin II and Whitewing are legally distinct from t=\nhe company. Institutional investors bought notes issued by the trusts. The =\n$3.4 billion in proceeds from the notes flowed to Enron.=20\nBoth trusts are scheduled to unwind in 2003. Originally, Enron had hoped to=\n repay them by selling the trusts' underlying assets. This repayment method=\n would have had a minimal impact on Enron's balance sheet.=20\nHowever, there's a potential problem brewing with this approach. The value =\nof the assets may be too low to raise sufficient funds to pay back the trus=\nt investors. Hence Enron's two unenviable options: issuing stock, or raisin=\ng cash from its own balance sheet.=20\nEnron treasurer Ben Glisan concedes that assets in Marlin II won't be suffi=\ncient to pay it back. But he adds that proceeds from planned sales of on-ba=\nlance sheet assets will provide Enron with the necessary funds for Marlin I=\nI. When asked if Whitewing's assets are adequate for repayment, Glisan repl=\nied: \"We believe so.\"=20\nIn reference to the two trusts, Enron CEO Kenneth Lay said on a conference =\ncall Tuesday: \"We anticipate the sale of assets will be the primary source =\nof repayments.\"=20\nSterling Marlin\nTheStreet.com hasn't seen offering documentation for Whitewing; Enron didn'=\nt provide it when requested. But TSC has reviewed the Marlin II prospectus.=\n Here's how Marlin II works. Enron took water assets, primarily based in th=\ne U.K., off its balance sheet, and the Marlin II trust took a stake in them=\n. Meanwhile, Marlin II issued senior debt to investors, the proceeds of whi=\nch went to Enron. The company didn't have to recognize these notes as debt =\non its balance sheet, due to the structure of the trust. Marlin II replaced=\n a similar trust called Marlin that was set to mature at the end of this ye=\nar.=20\nIdeally, the aim was for Enron managers to maximize the value and profitabi=\nlity of the assets over the life of Marlin and Marlin II so it could sell t=\nhem off and pay down the trusts. To cover the risk that asset sales wouldn'=\nt raise enough money, Enron also pledged to issue as much new convertible p=\nreferred stock as might be needed to pay off the notes.=20\nAs it happened, the water assets didn't perform well. In fact, Enron set up=\n Marlin II in July to succeed the original Marlin because it wanted to avoi=\nd paying off the first Marlin with convertible stock, or with cash from its=\n own balance sheet. This move risked angering the rating agencies that had =\nagreed not to treat Marlin as debt because of Enron's pledge to backstop it=\n with preferred stock. Suddenly, it seemed Enron was wriggling out of its c=\nommitment to make good with stock.=20\nEnron's Glisan responds that many of the investors in the first Marlin also=\n invested in Marlin II, illustrating that investors weren't upset by the ma=\nneuver.=20\nGlisan says Enron almost certainly won't decide to issue stock to pay off M=\narlin II. Instead, he adds, money from pending asset sales can be used to p=\nay it off when it matures in July 2003. When asked if Enron might use the e=\nxpected $1.9 billion in proceeds from selling Portland General, the utility=\n based in Portland, Ore., Glisan replied: \"That's a good one.\"=20\nBut using the Portland General windfall would run counter to Enron's freque=\nntly stated strategy of selling off low-yielding assets and investing the p=\nroceeds in higher-yielding businesses. Portland General is almost certainly=\n a more profitable business than the U.K.'s Wessex Water, which is the domi=\nnant asset in Marlin II. In addition, doing so would mean Enron couldn't us=\ne all the Portland proceeds to pay off debt. Enron aims to get its debt-to-=\ntotal-capital ratio down to 40%, from the current 50%.=20\nMaturity\nWhat about Whitewing, which matures in early 2003? Glisan lists Whitewing's=\n assets as: Central American gas distribution assets; turbines destined for=\n European power stations; interests in European power stations; and various=\n debt and equity participations in energy investments. Glisan says these as=\nsets can be sold to pay off the $2.4 billion in notes issued by the trust.=\n=20\nBut what would happen if the Whitewing assets can't fetch the necessary pri=\nce? Enron could sell off more on-balance-sheet assets. But, again, this wou=\nldn't help debt-reduction efforts, and it may be running short of large ass=\nets that it can quickly sell.=20\nWhitewing is backed with Enron convertible stock. But Enron may be reluctan=\nt to issue paper when its stock is so far below recent highs, and current s=\nhareholders may begrudge the prospect of further dilution.=20\nInvestors also need to keep their eyes on the early-repayment triggers of t=\nhe trusts. In fact, the stock price-related element of the triggers has alr=\neady been set off. For Whitewing, the stock has to fall below $59.78; for M=\narlin II, the stock has to be under $34.13. However, something else has to =\nhappen before the trust investors can claim their money back through asset =\nsales and stock issuance. Enron's credit rating must fall below investment =\ngrade. That looks to be a long shot, since its rating is currently three no=\ntches above subinvestment grade. But it is something the market will watch =\nafter Moody's said last week that it was putting Enron on review for a poss=\nible downgrade.=20\nDespite all the questions stemming from the trusts, Enron still seems keen =\nto use the structure. Last week, Barclays Capital was inviting investors to=\n subscribe to an Enron-related entity called the Besson Trust. This is bein=\ng set up to enable Enron \"to monetize substantially all of its interests in=\n EOTT Energy Partners,\" an Enron affiliate that markets and transports crud=\ne oil. Expected proceeds from the deal are $227 million, according to the p=\nrospectus. Could Enron be setting up new trusts to pay off damaged old trus=\nts?=20\nDue to off-balance sheet financings like Marlin II and Whitewing, it's clea=\nr that uncertainty could weigh on Enron's battered stock for some time.=20\n\n\n\n\nWhy Enron's Writedown Unnerves Some Investors\nBy Peter Eavis <mailto:peavis@thestreet.com>\nSenior Columnist\nTheStreet.com\n10/22/2001 07:15 AM EDT\nURL: <http://www.thestreet.com/markets/detox/10002713.html>\n\nEnron is trying to improve disclosure to investors, but its decision to red=\nuce equity by $1.2 billion in the third quarter has created dismay and conf=\nusion in the market.=20\nThe action was disclosed in a dubiously discreet manner. More important, in=\nvestors are struggling to pinpoint how the shrinkage will affect Enron's ba=\nlance sheet, profits and earnings guidance.=20\nEnron didn't provide answers to questions submitted on the equity reduction=\n.=20\nEnron doesn't include a balance sheet in its earnings release, so the equit=\ny decrease couldn't be spotted in numbers supplied Tuesday. And even though=\n Enron did break out $1 billion in earnings charges in its release, the com=\npany didn't feel it necessary to mention the equity write down anywhere in =\nthe text.=20\nInstead, the public first heard about it on a Tuesday conference call. CEO =\nKenneth Lay said Enron had shrunk its equity as a result of terminating a s=\no-called \"structured finance arrangement.\" The Wall Street Journal later re=\nported that Enron's counter-party in this transaction was an investment par=\ntnership called LJM2 Co-Investment, which has set up and run by Enron's fin=\nance chief, Andrew Fastow.=20\nThis is what Lay said on the Tuesday call about the equity move: \"In connec=\ntion with the early termination, shareholders' equity will be reduced appro=\nximately $1.2 billion, with a corresponding significant reduction in the nu=\nmber of diluted shares outstanding.\" According to The Journal, Lay then sai=\nd Wednesday on another call that Enron had repurchased 55 million shares.=\n=20\nEnron's supporters count Lay's mention of a reduction in the share count as=\n bullish, because it should boost earnings per share numbers in the future.=\n=20\nBut there are two possible problems with this theory.=20\nFirst, Enron affirmed its previous earnings guidance that it expects to mak=\ne $2.15 per share in operating earnings next year. Critically, the company =\ndid not say whether its guidance was given using a share count without the =\n55 million shares or not. If the forecast does assume the exclusion of the =\n55 million shares, the company should have upped its 2002 per-share earning=\ns forecast by around 6%, since that's the amount by which the share count w=\nill be reduced. Enron needs to say what share count it's using in its guida=\nnce.=20\nSecond, it's almost impossible to determine where these shares were ever re=\ncorded, casting a certain amount of doubt on Lay's assertion that the share=\n count will come down.=20\nWhy question the CEO? Well, in its 2000 annual report, Enron included some =\ndisclosure of the 55 million shares connected with LJM2. It reads: \"At Dece=\nmber 31, 2000, Enron had derivative instruments...on 54.8 million shares of=\n Enron common stock.\" The derivative instruments appear to be types of opti=\nons, or agreements that give the counterparty the right to buy or sell stoc=\nk at agreed prices.=20\nBut these derivatives-linked shares don't show up where they should in the =\nannual report: in the table that breaks out the difference between the basi=\nc and diluted share counts. The line item in this table that shows options-=\nrelated shares totals only 43 million shares, which is close to the amount =\nof employee pay options that qualified for inclusion. Therefore, that numbe=\nr almost certainly doesn't include the 55 million LJM2-related shares. The =\nfact is, at least some of the 55 million derivatives-linked shares should b=\ne included if the derivatives were like normal options. That's because the =\nLJM2 derivatives appear to have been \"in the money\", or profitable for the =\nholders. Typically, all in-the-money options-based stock has to be included=\n in the diluted share count. And these LJM2 derivatives did appear to have =\nthat status at the end of 2000. Back then, Enron stock was trading around $=\n80, way above the average $68 level at which these derivatives made money f=\nor LJM2.=20\nMaybe these weren't simple options and had other conditions attached that e=\nxcluded them from the diluted share count. That's what disclosure elsewhere=\n in the annual report appears to imply. Alternatively, the options were emb=\nedded somewhere else in the share count table or equity disclosure, though =\nit's hard think where.=20\nPresumably, investors will get a full explanation in Enron's quarterly fina=\nncial results filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, due by th=\ne middle of November."

The number of employees affected by this decision wasn't immediately available, Ms. Denne said. \nBefore Thursday's announcement, the company's shares were trading lower on the New York Stock Exchange. But in afternoon trading today, shares of Enron (ENE) were up $1.11, or 3.3% to $34.60. With these latest gains, the stock is now up about 40% from the three-year low of $24.46 set a week ago. \nFor several months, Enron shares have been under pressure as investors struggled to assess the impact of a number of negative developments, including declining energy prices, the recent and sudden departure of its chief executive, disappointing performance of its broadband unit and difficulties at its Indian power plant project. \nThe stock has made steady progress this week as investors shopped for bargains or were encouraged by progress Enron made in its plan to divest itself of some overseas assets. \nOn Wednesday, Enron announced the sale of some Indian oil and gas assets to BG Group PLC (BRG), a United Kingdom oil and gas company. \nJ.P. Morgan analyst Anatol Feygin said the stock also received further support by the reaffirmation of earnings forecasts at rivals Dynegy Inc. (DYN) and Aquila Inc.

(ENE) is looking to cut its workforce in Europe by up to 10%, or around 500 jobs, Enron Europe Chief Executive John Sherriff said Thursday. \n\"We have around 5,000 employees in Europe and we are seeking to cut our headcount here by between 5% and 10%, but we will aim as far as possible to achieve this through a program of voluntary severance,\" Sherriff replied in a written response to questions by Dow Jones Newswires.\nThe cuts are the first significant retrenchment by Enron since it arrived in Europe in 1989. Enron has been the most aggressive U.S. energy company to expand into Europe's deregulating markets, but its core energy trading businesses have been held back by the slow and piecemeal progress toward market liberalization in the E.U. \nThe company declined to be more specific about how far it will scale back individual product lines or coverage of certain geographical businesses. \n\nEnron's product range in Europe has mushroomed over the past year, continually giving rise to market talk, notably among its competitors, of overstretching itself prematurely in underdeveloped markets. \n\"Enron's business continues to grow in Europe in terms of traded volumes and numbers of transactions, but like any company we are constantly seeking ways to do more with less in order to maintain earnings growth,\" Sherriff said. \n\"It is prudent for us to keep both a close eye on our costs and to continually review the skills and resources that are available to use, to ensure that they are deployed in a way to maximize earnings,\" he added. \nWhile trading volumes have exploded in core markets such as U.K. power trading since wholesale market reforms were introduced in March, liquidity in other products such as bandwidth, monomers and credit risk, is understood to have developed more slowly and restricted the volume growth needed to justify Enron's pure trading strategy. \nEnron has been among the most prominent exponents of a new philosophy in energy markets that places far more emphasis on risk management skills than the physical ownership of assets, a radical change from the asset-heavy approach to energy that prevailed in Europe before the E.U.'s deregulation directive came into effect in 1999. \nAs such, it has in the last 18 months disposed of assets such as its stake in Sutton Bridge power station in England and has conspicuously refrained from buying 'brownfield' physical assets in markets such as Italy and Germany. \nHowever, it has pursued various greenfield independent power projects and the acquisition of gas trading licenses in markets such as Spain and Italy. \n-By Geoffrey T.

(ENE), Duke Energy (DUK), AES Corp. (AES) and Exelon Corp. (EXC). \nSelect Energy announced an agreement Tuesday to purchase the wholesale and retail energy sales unit of Syracuse, New York-based Niagara Mohawk Holdings Inc. (NMK), which is active in the Mid-Atlantic and New York power markets. \nIntegration plans aren't firm, but Select Energy will work with Niagara Mohawk executives to identify best practices from both companies, Schivley said. \nThe companies aim to have a transition plan ready by the time federal energy regulators rule on the combination. Select Energy has said it plans to keep Niagara Mohawk's Syracuse office open. \nThe company won't release the terms of the deal until it closes, which is expected in late November. \nSelect has annual revenues of about $2.5 billion. Niagara Mohawk Energy Marketing had revenues of $635 million in 2000. \nSelect Energy is still looking at further acquisitions of trading operation and generating assets in New York and the Mid-Atlantic, Schivley said. \n\"This is more than just window shopping,\" Schivley said. \"We are actively seeking out hard assets.\" \nThe company isn't interested, however, in the two other unregulated units Niagara Mohawk is looking to sell in advance of its acquisition by National Grid Group PLC (NGG), he added. \nWithin the next three to five years, more and more large companies are likely to start outsourcing management of their energy needs, especially as those needs become more complicated, Schivley said. Energy, along with labor and raw materials, are companies' three biggest expenses, he said. \n\"We're trying to grow this business by leaps and bounds,\" Schivley said. \"We've taken a giant step in New York. All the products we offer will be expanded dramatically and increased to a number that, without the acquisition, would have taken us a year or two to get to.\" \n-By Kristen McNamara, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-2061; kristen.mcnamara@dowjones.com\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., who is spearheading the effort. \nSpeaking with reporters prior to Wednesday's hearing, DeFazio complained that \"a bunch of bureaucrats\" at FERC are embracing the national power-grid agenda of Enron Corp. (ENE) without assessing the costs and regardless of \"what it does for local reliability.\" \nDeFazio's complaints were echoed in the testimony presented at Wednesday's hearing. \nThe region already enjoys an open and competitive transmission network, thanks to the federally owned Bonneville Power Administration, according to hearing testimony expressing concern that RTO West, as the RTO proposed for the region is called, will cost more to implement than it will provide in benefits. \n\"We are troubled that RTO West will not achieve any net benefit for end-use consumers in the Northwest,\" the Public Power Council testified. \"Although work is beginning on a cost-benefit study, we are troubled that a transmission system that has served us all well for so long will be disassembled because FERC has announced that RTOs, by definition, are good.\" \n\"Regional transmission organizations may be necessary to remedy the transmission ills in other regions of the country, but not in the Northwest,\" declared a group of transmission-dependent utilities. \n\"The 'balkanization' and isolation of transmission systems that characterize most other regions is simply not present in the Northwest. For this reason, the economic power-side benefits of an RTO will be relatively small,\" said a group of aluminum producers. \nSimilar cost-benefit concerns have been voiced by state utility regulators in the Eastern U.S. who oppose FERC's effort to consolidate grid assets under large RTOs in the Southeast and Northeast. \n'RTO Week' \n\nFERC Chairman Pat Wood III acknowledged the complaints Thursday, adding that he expected to address the concerns of regulators and industry during \"RTO Week\" Oct. 15, when the commission will hold five days of hearings on the commission's RTO mandate. \n\"I think I need the decisionmakers at the table. We've had the lawyers in the suits arguing about it for eight years now,\" Wood said at an \"energy community\" forum sponsored by Enron in Arlington, Va. \nWood told Dow Jones Newswires following his remarks at the Enron forum that FERC answered the complaints about the lack of a cost-benefit analysis at its Sept. 26 meeting. \nThe commission agreed to undertake a comprehensive analysis in support of its claim that RTOs will bring about operational efficiencies that will translate into consumer savings. \nWood also noted a study by Mirant Corp. (MIR), which concluded that combining the three independent system operators in the Northeast into a single RTO would produce $440 million in annual consumer benefits. \nDuring the Enron forum, Edward Meyers, a regulator with the District of Columbia Public Service Commission, urged Wood to seek out the input of affected state regulators. \nMeyers noted that he is in the minority among regulators in the region in supporting the Northeast RTO grid-consolidation, while most others oppose the effort as \"economically dangerous.\" \nArnetta McRae, chairman of the Delaware Public Service Commission, told Wood that her fellow state regulators aren't so much opposed to grid regionalization but the lack of consultation by FERC. \nThe state regulators want \"an opportunity to be at the table,\" McRae said. If such a process were offered, there would be a lot less opposition, she predicted. \nFERC is reaching out to address the concerns of state regulators, Wood said, adding that he was \"blindsided\" by the opposition among state regulators to FERC's grid-consolidation mandate. \nLater in the day, Wood told reporters that \"RTO Week\" will feature an entire hearing devoted to the concerns of state regulators. \nAt the Enron forum, Wood defended the commission's RTO policy, which calls for carving up the nation's interconnected electricity system under the control of four or five large RTOs, as necessary to jump-start the overly long transition from regulation to competition. \n\"This process needs to be goosed,\" said Wood, calling FERC's RTO orders \"an external catalyst\" to get the process moving. \n\"If I'm wrong, I'd love to find a better way around that,\" he said. \n-By Bryan Lee, Dow Jones Newswires; 202-862-6647; Bryan.Lee@dowjones.com\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

JOSEF HEBERT\nAssociated Press Writer\n\n10/04/2001\nAssociated Press Newswires\nCopyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - North Carolina and several other states told the Supreme Court the government went too far when it ordered electric utilities to open their power lines to competitors and spurred a movement toward deregulation. \nBut one of the country's largest power marketers, Enron, argued before the court Wednesday that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission should have gone even further to help companies like Enron get equal access to power grids.\nDuring the hourlong hearing, the justices gave little indication of how they will decide on a case that could dramatically affect management of the nation's power grids and the future of electricity competition. \nAt one point, Justice Stephen Breyer said FERC, which regulates wholesale power markets and interstate transmission of power, was being \"whipsawed\" from both directions. \nThe commission's 1996 decision, which for the first time required traditional utilities to open their transmission lines to competing power merchants, triggered a movement toward wholesale electricity competition and led numerous states to end monopolies in retail power markets. \nBut utility regulators in nine states, led by New York, filed suit arguing that the FERC order amounts to a federal agency attempting to regulate retail sales, usurping a traditional state function. \nAt the same time, Enron's lawsuit charged that FERC violated federal law because it did not require access to transmission lines when utilities continued to keep transmission and retail sales as one operation - as remains the case in many states that have yet to allow competition. \nIn June 2000, an appellate court essentially upheld FERC's regulation, prompting appeals from both Enron and the state regulators. \n\"It's an example of where an agency has overstepped its bounds,\" Lawrence Malone, general counsel for the New York State Public Service Commission, told the justices at Wednesday's hearing. The other states party to the lawsuit are Florida, Idaho, New Jersey, North Carolina, Virginia, Washington, Vermont and Wyoming. \nMalone, appearing on behalf of all nine states, argued that FERC's order pre-empts state authority to regulate retail sales and set rates. \n\"This case isn't about rates,\" countered Louis Cohen, representing Enron Power Marketing Inc. before the court. \"What we're concerned about is getting onto the (grid) system.\" \nCohen said that under the current access rules a dominant utility in a state that has not moved to competition may still \"hog\" the lines and keep Enron and similar marketers from moving power across a region. \nThe Justice Department, representing FERC before the court, argued that the commission only sought to strike a balance between the need to give competitors equal access to power lines and leaving retail market issues to the states. \nEdwin Kneedler, deputy solicitor general, told the court that FERC, in his view, could have gone further, as Enron has argued. But, he said, to do so it would first have had to order all utilities to separate retail sales and transmission, something it chose to leave to the states. \nThe case, which is not expected to be decided until sometime next year, comes at a time of growing concern about electricity competition and power grid reliability in light of recent power problems in California. \nAbout half of the states have taken some steps toward retail electricity competition. \nMany power industry experts as well as the FERC commissioners have emphasized that a truly competitive electricity market will be difficult to achieve without smooth and efficient flow of electricity across large regions, if not nationally. And that, argue companies like Enron who want to compete with traditional utilities, will require more open access to transmission. \nIn an attempt to smooth the flow of power, FERC has embarked on a campaign to establish four large, regional transmission organizations to manage the national power grid. A court decision rolling back some of FERC's authority over open access to transmission lines could affect that effort. \nUncertainty over how far the federal government will be allowed to go in requiring transmission access also could affect state decisions on whether to embrace electricity competition, according to some industry experts. \n--- \nOn the Net: \nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission: http://www.ferc.fed.us/ \nEnron: http://www.enron.com/corp/\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  \n\nRemember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  \n\nAs always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. \n\nFor that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins."

Kaiser Aluminum closed its =\nsmelting operations in the Pacific Northwest in late 2000, choosing to rese=\nll contracted power from the BPA on the spot market. According to the Spoke=\nsman Review, \"Kaiser netted more than $460 million from the sales.\" Other a=\nluminum companies reselling power from BPA reached agreements during spring=\n 2001 with Bonneville. Under these agreements, the companies agreed to keep=\n smelters off line to keep power supplies ample in the region, and BPA agre=\ned, in return, to give the smelters, when they restarted operations, a $20 =\nper megawatt-hour (MWh) credit for obtaining power from sources other than =\nBPA. Months of wrangling produced a contract between Kaiser and the BPA tha=\nt negates a \"take-or-pay\" clause that would require Kaiser to pay for the f=\nederal power whether used or not. BPA said, \"Under the agreement signed tod=\nay, Kaiser will avoid the possibility of paying damages if it does not take=\n all the power under the contract...And if [BPA] can't resell it, we are no=\nt going to hold [Kaiser] liable for the difference,\" Clearing Up reported. =\nAs a concession for the elimination of the \"take-or-pay\" clause, Kaiser wil=\nl receive interruptible service from the BPA on some of its 240 MW load. Ka=\niser received criticism from union groups who claimed that the company was =\nusing the money it had gained reselling power \"to pay down long-term debt, =\nrebuild a refinery in Louisiana and reward executives with excessive bonuse=\ns,\" rather than splitting the money between workers that had been laid off,=\n the BPA, and building generation, AP reported.

Texan Doll \"had prev=\niously worked for several communications and consulting firms,\" and will be=\n receiving a salary of $200,000 as the power authority's CEO, according to =\nthe San Francisco Chronicle. S. David Freeman, the authority's chair, will =\nretain his post. Freeman said he will \"handle fewer administrative duties,\"=\n and will \"be able to devote more time to reaching out to interest groups s=\nuch as the Legislature and consumer groups,\" The Chronicle reported. Accord=\ning to a 7 October report in the Orange County Register, consumer groups, b=\nusinesses, and the legislature have questioned the recent actions of the po=\nwer authority, which has vowed to secure nearly 3,000 megawatts (MW) of pow=\ner by summer 2002 to avoid power shortages. The power authority, which was =\ncreated by Governor Gray Davis and the state Legislature in May 2001, can i=\nssue up to $5 billion in bonds to bolster the state's power supply through =\nfinancing new renewable generation or peaker projects. The Register said th=\nat businesses and consumer groups are worried that higher electricity rates=\n could be the result of the power authority initiative to bring 1,000 MW of=\n green power and 2,000 MW of peaker generation on line by summer 2002. The =\nstate's Joint Legislative Audit Committee would look into the authority's p=\nlanned purchases, according to the committee chair, Assembly member Fred Ke=\neley. Keeley said \"it's appropriate early and often to review their work in=\n a public venue and have them held accountable for compliance of the law,\" =\nthe Register reported.

Dynegy Corp., Mirant Corp., Williams Cos., and Relia=\nnt Energy were the companies specifically mentioned. Under a 19 June FERC o=\nrder, price limits were established in 11 Western states to help tame the v=\nolatile electricity spot market. The June order stated that companies charg=\ning in excess of the mitigated price had seven days past the end of the mon=\nth in question to file justifications for their overcharges. The 5 October =\norder said that the aforementioned companies filed justifications, but all =\nwere rejected, and that other companies that overcharged during July, but d=\nid not file justifications, would also be subject to ordered refunds. Altho=\nugh FERC did not release specific figures, the California Independent Syste=\nm Operator said that total overcharges for the month amounted to $260,000, =\nThe Los Angeles Times reported. The commission's order explained the reject=\nion of cost justifications for the four companies. The explanations by Mira=\nnt and Dynegy, filed more than seven days after July ended, were \"untimely =\nand...neither company supported in detail its actual costs for its transact=\nions,\" according to the document. Reliant's filing was \"not consistent with=\n the requirements of the June 19 Order,\" and Willams \"did not provide any c=\nost support for its transactions beyond restating general objections to the=\n commission's pricing methodology,\" the commissioners wrote. A Mirant spoke=\nsman told Reuters that \"his company was ordered to refund $33,800,\" while a=\n Williams spokesman told the LA Times \"$30,000 worth of electricity sales a=\nre subject to the FERC rebate for both June and July.\" More... <https://www=\n2.enronforum.com/content?content_id=3D115981303>=20\n\n=20\n\n  <http://www2.intellibridge.com/graphics/TopAnalysis3.gif>=09  =09\nUnited States-Security: Role of Homeland Defense Czar <https://www2.enronfo=\nrum.com/content?content_id=3D115979303>\nNorth America-Energy: Texas Faces Transmission Line Shortages <https://www2=\n.enronforum.com/content?content_id=3D115986903>\n=09\n  =09\n <https://ib.intellibridge.com/intellimemo>  <https://ib.intellibridge.com/=\nexpertlink> =09\n =09\n\n"

(wwwowe.water.ca.gov).. nothing too illuminating except that their power costs have come down from over $300 in march to$45 this month but due to the nature the borrowing costs associated with the LT contracts, they will not be able to pass on much savings to consumers (gotta love that).\n\nwe were supposed to have received a copy of all their LT purchases in July. checking what happened there.  we know that there were 54 contracts signed .. half linked to gas which covered 1/3 of cali's total needs (looks like for 10 years).  some left open the possibility of the state procuring gas supplies for the plants.. dwr has signed 6 agreements w/ gas suppliers..pretty sure cali uses 25,000-45,000 MW per year which is about 70 contracts a day in gas terms.  If they locked in 1/3.. it would be about 25/day.. the deal they just did was about 16/day for just cal02..probably waiting for curve to flatten further to do more..\n\nthey purchased another 500 MW in Aug - the 17th (all 10-12 years)..and to date it looks like they have not purchased anything (have been selling into the grid daily) but not liquidating any previously negotiated LT deals (LT is anything beyond 3 months).\n\nit sounds like they are planning on buying more of their gas requirements.. Sempra (who has LT power contracts with DWR and gives them the ability to buy 80% of their gas) said DWR had not purchased any gas yet.\n\n \n\n \n\nPls note story on page 5 & 6 of todays gas daily... \n\nmentions California Dept of Water looking to hedge gas purchases for long-term contracts. \n\nover the past few days we have seen Major Inv. Bk Buying  Cal 02 Nymex Calls and the same bank buying Cal 02 Socal basis calls - very good size\n\nThis, we believe, is a hedge for this DWR story. The article mentions that they were \"looking at ways to expand its gas purchases\".\n\nThe article does not mention, nor do we know, how far out they are looking to purchase. \n\nSocal basis has moved on the back of this deal.... \nLast week: \nCal 02 = 9 cents    Cal 03 = 20 cents \n\nToday \nCal 02 = 18.5 cents   Cal 03 = 22 cents....so the spread has moved from 11 cent  contango  to 3.5 cents. \n\n<<102401.pdf>> \n\nOther than the call buying we saw related to this deal, the rest of the flow we are seeing is : sellers of vol. \nLast night settles: \nCal 02 vol  51.5% and Cal 03 vol 37.25% - and we are 1 % lower in Cal 02 since the open , and 0.5 % lower Cal 03. \n"

All Rights Reserved. \t\n\nEnergy Security Concerns On Congressional Front Burner\nBy Bryan Lee\n\n10/05/2001\nDow Jones Energy Service\n(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)\n\nOF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \n\nWASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- Congressional passage of energy policy legislation is unlikely to happen this year as energy infrastructure security has jumped to the forefront as a priority concern after Sept. 11, according to key House and Senate lawmakers.\n\"I'm not sure there'll be a bill this year,\" said Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. \nIt will be too difficult to reach agreement on the issues involved in passing a comprehensive energy policy bill and still get the measure through conference committee and to the president's desk before Congress adjourns this fall, Bingaman told an industry-sponsored forum this week. \nBingaman has slated a hearing on energy infrastructure security for Tuesday, and plans to move legislation on the subject separately from the energy-policy bill. In advance of next week's hearing, Bingaman has solicited comments from leading energy industry groups. \n\"The priorities have changed since Sept. 11,\" said Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, chairman of the House Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee. \"The energy security issue is now paramount,\" he said. \nBarton announced this week that he wouldn't launch a campaign next year for the Senate seat being vacated by Phil Gramm, R-Texas. The decision stemmed in part from a desire to stay at the House Energy and Commerce Committee panel he chairs to work on energy infrastructure concerns. \nCongress will pass energy-policy legislation next year and focus on energy infrastructure security this year, Barton said, citing the threat to power plants, transmission lines, and natural gas and oil pipelines. \nThe two legislators spoke at an energy forum this week sponsored by Enron Corp. (ENE), entitled \"Energy Policy at a Crossroads.\" \nThe priority on infrastructure security was applauded by John M. Derrick, Jr., chairman and chief executive of Potomac Electric Power Co. (POM). \n\"We in the industry are concerned about an energy hit on our infrastructure,\" Derrick told the two lawmakers. \nThat concern is well-founded, according to James R. Schlesinger, who in past administrations headed the departments of energy and defense, and the Central Intelligence Agency. \n\"Our electric power grid is particularly vulnerable,\" Schlesinger said, particularly citing the threat from \"information warfare.\" \nSchlesinger's warning was borne out the week after Sept. 11. The North American Electric Reliability Council, the industry group that coordinates power-grid reliability, reported last month its telephones and other communications were temporarily knocked out during a flurry of computer virus attacks. \nWith the onset of increasing wholesale power market competition, the U.S. power grid is operating at a much higher capacity than ever before, making it vulnerable to physical or electronic attack, said Schlesinger. \nThis risk has been compounded since competition has \"weakened the incentive\" for utilities to make needed investment in transmission infrastructure, Schlesinger said. \nHouse Panel Acts On Nuclear Security \n\nWhile Bingaman's committee prepares to tackle the issue beginning next week, the House Energy and Commerce Committee took a first stab at the issue this week. \nOn Wednesday, as part of a package of three antiterrorism bills, the panel adopted legislation making sabotage at a nuclear power facility a federal crime and authorizing plant security guards to carry weapons and make arrests. \nThe committee adopted an amendment sponsored by Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., requiring the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission to undertake a comprehensive rulemaking to revise its power-plant security regime. \n\"As terrible as the attacks of Sept. 11 were, a successful terrorist assault on a nuclear power plant could result in a full-scale nuclear core meltdown and breach of containment that could result in countless more deaths and injuries,\" said Markey, who opposes nuclear power. \nThe NRC previously announced it is undertaking a top-to-bottom review of its security requirements in light of the Sept. 11 attacks. \"As decisions are made, they will be implemented,\" said NRC spokesman William Beecher, who otherwise declined to comment on the House action, which is under review by the agency. \nThe Nuclear Energy Institute, the industry's trade group, criticized the House action as a rash response to the Sept. 11 attacks. Nuclear power plant security issues should be addressed as part of an overall effort to secure U.S. energy infrastructure, NEI said. \n\"We believe the security issue has to be addressed in a comprehensive and thoughtful way. That wasn't done Wednesday,\" said John Kane, NEI's vice president for governmental affairs. \nKane also called for Congress to firmly delineate the responsibilities of the federal government and industry in securing nuclear power plants against attack. It isn't appropriate for private industry to respond to threats from enemies of state, he said. \nBingaman, the Senate chairman, said Wednesday that, while he supports federalizing airport security, he believes that nuclear power plant defenses should remain the responsibility of the industry. \n-By Bryan Lee, Dow Jones Newswires; 202-862-6647; Bryan.Lee@dowjones.com\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Industry lobbying groups Edison Electric \nInstitute and Electric Power Supply Association filed court \nbriefs supporting Enron's position ... (corrects Edison's \nposition). \nA corrected repetition follows. \nBy Chris Baltimore \nWASHINGTON, Oct 3 (Reuters) - With billions of dollars at stake in the electricity market, lawyers for Enron Corp urged the U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday to uphold federal regulators' obligation to drive open competition on the nation's transmission grid. \nThe nation's highest court heard oral arguments in the case which could have sweeping implications for the $220 billion U.S. electricity market. \nThe Supreme Court's ruling could either open the U.S. transmission grid to retail competition, or limit open markets to just the wholesale realm. \nA decision is expected later this year or early in 2002. \n\"It's billions and billions of dollars at stake\" for energy firms, said an industry source. \"A ruling could expand existing open wholesale markets to the retail level.\" \nThe case is on appeal from the U.S. Appeals Court for the District of Columbia, which upheld FERC's authority to regulate state transmission in a June 2000 ruling. \nNEW YORK SAYS FERC WENT TOO FAR \nEnron - the largest U.S. wholesale power player and an ardent proponent of open markets and nationwide deregulation - argued the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission should have authority to force competition of all transmission assets. \nFERC should expand its authority beyond wholesale markets and states that have deregulated retail markets, Enron says. \n\"You need a set of rules of the road that apply to everybody,\" said Enron attorney Louis Cohen. Industry lobbying group Electric Power Supply Association filed court briefs supporting Enron's position, while Edison Electric Institute filed in support of FERC. \nMeanwhile, in a separate companion case, the state of New York argued FERC went too far in regulating flows of electricity within the state. \n\"This is an example of an agency that has overstepped its bounds,\" said Lawrence Malone, general counsel for the New York State Public Service Commission. \nNew York wants the court to revoke FERC's authority to regulate retail sales, because electricity involved in such sales stays within state boundaries and is not subject to federal regulation. \n\"We now have two hands on the retail wheel and it doesn't work,\" Malone told the court. \nStuck squarely in the middle is FERC, which derives its mandate from an interpretation of the Federal Power Act of 1935. \nFERC ORDERED OPEN ACCESS \nAt issue is Order 888, which FERC approved in 1996 after it found that transmission-owning utilities have an inherent incentive to bar access to their wires by competing companies. \nThe order essentially opened the grid to wholesale competition by forcing utilities to offer nondiscriminatory policies to energy firms that want to ship electricity over non-owned transmission lines. \nNew York argues that FERC's 1996 order oversteps state authority over intrastate commerce set in the 1935 law, while Enron asserts FERC did not go far enough and needs to expand its authority to both retail and wholesale markets. \nBecause of the interwoven nature of the transmission grid, electricity that flows within state boundaries cannot be distinguished from power that flows from state to state as a result of wholesale sales, Enron's Cohen argued. \nAll of the electricity is competing for space on the grid, and Enron wants FERC to step in to prevent state utilities from \"being able to hog those sites for their own use and keep us off the road,\" Cohen told the court. \nThe Supreme Court justices' leanings on the case were unclear from oral arguments, where they questioned lawyers on interpreting the 1935 act. \nAt least one justice found the intricacies of electricity transmission mechanics daunting. \n\"It's not like putting water through a dam,\" said Justice Stephen Breyer. \"I don't even know how this works.\"\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Analysts say this system stymies investment in the energy sector, especially in the much-needed natural gas-fired plants, as returns cannot be guaranteed. \nMost of Brazil's natural gas is imported, and its price in local currency terms grows higher when the real depreciates against the dollar. So far this year, the real has lost about 30 percent of its value. \n\"We can't have these plants standing idle while the country needs energy,\" Parente said, citing the example of a plant finished by U.S. energy giant Enron Corp. last month, which is not operating due to a lack of contracts at market prices. \nBrazil needs gas-fired plants as it struggles to reduce its dependence on hydroelectric stations. Two years of droughts have dried up water reservoirs at these plants triggering this year's acute power shortage, which forced the government to impose tough power rationing from June. \nThere is a virtual Wholesale Electricity Market (MAE) in Brazil, but it only quotes prices for electricity and has never seen a single contract struck due to high prices there and existing contracts between generators and distributors. \nNow, the government's Brazilian Emergency Energy Sales (CBEE) entity, should provide contracts for the new plants at attractive prices taken from MAE. \nThe government expects 10 power plants with a total capacity of 2,153 megawatts to become operational by March 2002, which should boost the total generation capacity of some 70,000 megawatts. \nApart from Enron's, a plant built by U.S.-based El Paso Corp. is also ready to start producing energy. \nThe head of Brazil's National Development Bank (BNDES), Francisco Gros, pointed out the financial guarantee would have a limit, which is yet to be established. \nGros also acknowledged that the electricity tariffs would have to be reviewed to take into account losses by power utilities since the start of rationing as well as prices to be charged by new power stations. \n\"We are thinking of a differential hike which can occur gradually, so that it doesn't hit the pocket so much,\" he said, explaining that the losses from lower power consumption totaled 20 percent of revenues on average. \nGros also said the bank had enough resources to finance investment projects in the electricity sector and boost the offer of power.\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. \t\n\n\nBrazil To Guarantee Contracts In Wholesale Power Market\n\n10/05/2001\nDow Jones International News\n(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)\n\nRIO DE JANEIRO -(Dow Jones)- The Brazilian government will intervene in the virtually nonexistent wholesale energy market, known as MAE, by paying new merchant power generators in advance for their contracts, top officials said Friday. \nThe decision is valid for independent power generators such as Enron Corp's (ENE) Eletrobolt facility and El Paso Corp.'s (EPG) Macae Merchant unit, which couldn't sell the energy they started producing due to regulatory problems on the MAE.\nAccording to the government's emergency plan to generate more power, these plants were supposed to sell their electricity on the free market according to their concession licenses. \n\"The MAE isn't working and these power plants can't sell the electricity which is already available,\" said Francsico Gros, president of Brazil's Development Bank BNDES, who is heading a commission to come up with a new model for the nation's troubled power sector. \"This is a serious problem which is hurting energy supply when we need all the electricity we can get.\" \nGros said more than 2,000 megawatts of new electricity are \"waiting to be sold\" but hasn't reached distributors because there hasn't been any trading on the MAE. \nA recently-created state-run company, called CBEE, will be responsible for settling the contracts for this energy. A percentage of the value of the contract will be paid up front by Brazil's Treasury to guarantee to generators that the contracts will be honored. \nThe government will also establish a ceiling price for contracts. Currently, the price set for power trading at the MAE was 364.00 reals ($1=BRR2.737) per megawatt/hour. \nIn late August, the Brazilian government had already announced it would start buying electricity from independent generators to sell to distributors as an emergency measure aimed at easing the effects of a power crunch and guaranteeing some power supply over the short term. \nThe emergency measures come after the apparent failure of MAE, which kicked off about a year ago with the promise to create a new framework for transactions between power generators and distributors. \nBut regulatory problems robbed MAE of credibility, and the innovative electronic exchange system that was especially designed for the power exchange and was supposed to regulate energy trading, wasn't used at all. \nGros said the government is working to restore confidence in MAE by creating more transparent rules for trading on the free energy market. \n\"MAE is an essential part of our plan for Brazil's energy sector model,\" he said. \nSouth America's biggest economy is facing an unprecedented energy crisis after inadequate investment in the past few years and a drought this year that left water reservoirs at record-low levels. \nBrazil is more than 90% dependent on hydroelectric plants for the electric energy it consumes. An energy-rationing plan was implemented in June to cut electricity use by an average 20% per month. \n-By Adriana Brasileiro, Dow Jones Newswires; (5521) 9965-1193,\nadriana.brasileiro@dowjones.com\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Northwest would also assume $1 billion of debt, it said.\nThe deal would combine the gas and electric utilities serving Portland, Oregon. \nNorthwest shares were down $2.99, or 11.5 percent, at $23 in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange, giving up gains totaling $2.89 over the three previous sessions. \nEnron shares were up 25 cents at $33.35. \nIn a brief statement, Northwest said it was confirming the talks with Enron in response to press reports. It said there was no assurance that a deal would be struck and it would not make any additional comments on the matter unless and until a formal agreement was reached. \nThe Wall Street Journal described the talks as advanced. Citing people familiar with the matter, it said the discussions were at a delicate stage and financing could be a problem for Northwest, which had a market value of only $655.5 million based on Thursday's closing stock price of $25.99. \nNews of the talks did not surprise UBS Warburg analyst James Yannello, who said Enron has made no secret of its desire to divest Portland GE, which serves more than 725,000 customers in northwest Oregon. Enron, an energy marketing and trading powerhouse, acquired Portland GE in July 1997 for stock valued at $2.1 billion. \nNorthwest, doing business as NW Natural, is a gas distribution utility serving more than 500,000 customers throughout Oregon and Vancouver, Washington. On Friday the company raised its quarterly dividend for the 46th year in a row. \nENRON SEEN RECEPTIVE TO STOCK \nOn the possibility that Northwest might have trouble financing a deal, Yannello said that in the past Enron has been receptive to accepting stock. \nHe believes Enron \"is taking a very close look at all of its assets,\" and he sees several similar announcements over the next few months. \nPortland GE, a power generator and distributor, had 2000 revenues of $2.25 billion. Its 2001 first-half revenues rose to $1.6 billion from $827 million a year earlier, and net income increased to $71 million from $63 million. \nPortland GE pays Enron dividends totaling $20 million each quarter. \nPortland GE was founded in 1889, delivering power to the city of Portland from the Willamette Falls, 14 miles away on the Willamette River - the first long-distance transmission of electricity in the United States. \nThe company owns eight hydroelectric plants with a total capacity of 615 megawatts. It also has a 65 percent interest in a coal-fired power plant in Boardman, Ore., and a 20 percent stake in a Colstrip, Montana, power plant. These interests, along with 742 megawatts of gas-fired power plants in Clatskanie and Boardman, Oregon, give Portland GE total generation capacity of 1,399.9 megawatts.\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. \t\n\n\nEnron in Talks to Sell Portland General to Northwest (Update6)\n2001-10-05 16:09 (New York)\n\nEnron in Talks to Sell Portland General to Northwest (Update6)\n\n     (Adds closing share prices in ninth and 13th paragraphs.)\n\n     Houston, Oct. 5 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. may sell Portland\nGeneral Electric Co. to Northwest Natural Gas Co., another Oregon\nutility, as part of a plan to shed slow-growing businesses and\nfocus on commodities trading.\n\n     Northwest said the companies are in talks, though an\nagreement isn't assured. The negotiations come more than five\nmonths after the sale of Portland General to Sierra Pacific\nResources collapsed. Enron spokesman Mark Palmer wouldn't comment.\n\n     Enron has been trying to sell Portland General for about two\nyears. Houston-based Enron, once mainly an operator of natural-gas\npipelines, has transformed itself into the biggest trader of\nelectricity and gas, a business that doesn't require ownership of\nexpensive assets such as power plants and pipelines.\n\n     Portland General ``is regulated, and it's really slow growth,\nso it doesn't fit in with what Enron's trying to be,'' said Tara\nGately, an analyst with Loomis Sayles & Co., which holds about\n135,000 Enron shares.\n\n     The Wall Street Journal today reported that the two companies\nare negotiating a sale price of $2.8 billion in cash, stock and\nassumed debt. Enron bought Portland General in 1997 for $3.1\nbillion in stock and debt.\n\n     The utility's earnings are forecast to rise 1 percent next\nyear, said analyst Robert Christensen of First Albany Corp.\n\n     By comparison, Enron's profit from buying and selling\ncommodities such as energy, lumber and steel is increasing 25\npercent a year as more markets open to competition, said\nChristensen, who rates the shares ``strong buy'' and owns them.\n\n     ``It would just be a positive to get (the Portland General\nsale) done and use the cash for other businesses,'' Gately said.\n\n     Enron shares fell $1.37, or 4.1 percent, to $31.73.\n\n     Enron stock has declined 62 percent this year, mostly because\nof the resignation of Chief Executive Jeff Skilling, concerns\nabout the California power market, losses at its bandwidth-trading\nbusiness and an electricity-contract dispute in India. The stock\ndropped even as Enron said second-quarter earnings rose 40 percent\nto $404 million while revenue almost tripled to $50.1 billion.\n\n     Sierra Pacific canceled its proposed $3.1 billion acquisition\nof Portland General on April 26 because California's energy crisis\nmade it too hard to win approval. Legislators banned sales of\npower plants serving the state, blocking Sierra Pacific from\nselling a stake in a generating plant, needed to win clearance for\nthe deal.\n\n     ``It's a difficult regulatory environment,'' said Bern\nFleming, manager of the $2.4 billion AXP Utilities Income Fund,\nwhich holds about 300,000 Enron shares. ``I wonder if someone in\nthat region might handle it better.''\n\n                         Northwest\n\n     Northwest shares fell $2.58, or 9.9 percent, to $23.41,\ncutting its market value to about $588 million. The company, based\nin Portland, Oregon, would take on about $1 billion in debt with\nthe purchase, the Journal said.\n\n     Bond rating company Egan Jones lowered its credit rating on\nNorthwest to ``A-'' from ``A,'' still investment grade. Northwest\nalready has about $450 million in debt, Egan Jones said.\n\n     Other terms of the transaction need to be completed, and an\nagreement may be announced in a few days, the Journal reported.\n\n     Northwest serves more than half a million Oregon and\nWashington customers. Richard Reiten, Northwest's chairman and\nchief executive, was president of Portland General from 1989 to\n1996.\n\n     At a price of $2.8 billion, Northwest would be paying 1.2\ntimes sales, less than the average of four times revenue paid for\nU.S. utilities this year, Bloomberg data show.\n\n     ``It sounds like the transaction would result in Enron\nretaining a minority stake,'' said Andre Meade, an analyst at\nCommerzbank Securities Inc. who rates Enron ``accumulate'' and\ndoesn't own the stock. ``It may be that Northwest can only finance\na portion of the buy at this stage.''\n\n     Oregon regulators likely will approve the transaction if\nNorthwest shows that its service and rates will stay the same,\nMeade said.\n\n     The acquisition would allow Northwest to negotiate better gas\nprices by increasing the amount of the fuel that it buys, he said.\nThe company may also be able to cut costs through job cuts and\neliminating duplicate services.\n\n     Northwest said in July that second-quarter profit more than\ndoubled to $4.3 million as weather cooled and the company added\ncustomers.\n\n                    California Platform\n\n     Enron acquired Portland General, which has more than 700,000\ncustomers in Oregon, as a platform to sell power into California's\nderegulating market.\n\n     Since then, Enron has moved away from owning assets such as\npower plants and pipelines to concentrate on energy trading. As\npart of that shift, Enron this week agreed to sell oil and gas\nfields in India to the U.K.'s BG Group Plc for $388 million.\n\n     Portland General gave Enron experience with the electricity\nmarket and utility regulations, and helped the company develop its\npower-trading business, Loomis Sayles's Gately said.\n\n     Sierra Pacific, based in Reno, Nevada, agreed to buy Portland\nGeneral in November 1999. To win regulators' approval of the\nacquisition, Edison International's utility had to agree to sell a\nstake in a Nevada power plant also owned by Sierra.\n\n     California banned power-plant sales by the state's utilities\nbecause of its power shortage, blocking the Nevada sale. Enron\nsaid at the time that it wouldn't rule out trying again to sell\nthe utility.\n\n     ScottishPower Plc, the U.K.-based owner of the northwestern\nU.S. utility PacifiCorp, considered a bid for the utility, the\nObserver newspaper reported in April.\n\n"

The partnership, Whitewing LLP, held assets with a book value of $4.7 billion on Nov. 16 but a drop in the value of Enron stock held by the partnership could result in a derivative loss of $700 million, the company said.\nIn addition, Enron, Houston, said it may have to come up with more money to honor a collateral call on a $690 million note. That note became a \"demand obligation,\" on Nov. 12, when Enron's credit rating got lowered to triple-B-minus by Standard & Poor's. The company didn't disclose who holds the note. \n\"We've got nine days to either repay the note or post a letter of credit or they can start liquidating assets,\" said company spokesman Mark Palmer. One of the assets includes C.E.G. Rio, a gas distribution company in Brazil that Enron already is in the process of selling and whose proceeds it had intended to use for other forms of debt reduction. The company said it is trying to negotiate a waiver or extension of the credit provision with lenders to preserve its cash. \nEnron has set up a number of partnerships over the years to hedge investment risks and, in some cases, to keep debt off its balance sheet. In the wake of a Securities and Exchange Commission formal probe into its accounting and disclosure practices launched Oct. 31, the company restated its earnings downward dating back to 1997 and has consolidated some debt back onto its balance sheet. \nThe company on Nov. 9 agreed to merge with competitor Dynegy Inc. But its latest SEC filing said it was sued by shareholders on Nov. 12 in state court in Houston to prevent the merger from happening. The petition alleges that Enron's directors breached their fiduciary duties to Enron's shareholders by agreeing to sell Enron for inadequate consideration and without an adequate investigation of the alternatives available to Enron. Enron said it would vigorously defend itself. \nYesterday's filing included numerous changes in previously reported numbers for revenues and expenses. In its original third-quarter statement, the company reported a loss of $618 million. The stated loss was increased to $635 million last week and in the latest filing, the loss for the quarter ended Sept. 30 was widened to $664 million. \nEnron added that the numbers contained in latest filing aren't necessarily final because its external auditor, Arthur Andersen, hasn't completed its review, nor has an internal audit committee finished reviewing the firm's accounting practices.\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

All Rights Reserved\nSenior Wall Street bankers are concerned that Dynegy could walk away from its proposed $9.8bn ( #6.8bn) rescue bid for its rival energy group Enron - a move that would have severe repercussions for the energy trading sector and financial markets. \nIn a series of interviews with the Financial Times, bankers expressed worries that while credit rating agencies had been assured that it was extremely difficult for Dynegy to pull out, some of the company's shareholders were under the impression that the \"material adverse change\" clause could be triggered.\n\"There is no way you can say that this deal is definitely going to happen, or even likely to happen,\" one banker said. \"And the knock on effects of it not going ahead are not good,\" he added. None of the bankers would agree to be publicly identified. \nThe possibility of Dynegy dropping out of the deal was discussed when senior bankers from JP Morgan Chase and Citigroup, which are advising Enron, met with officials from Moody's, the credit rating agencies, 10 days ago. \nThe rating agency expressed concerns that it would be too easy for Dynegy to give up its bid, further undermining Enron's creditworthiness. \nMoody's decision to preserve Enron's investment grade rating was one of the main reasons why Dynegy was able to go ahead with its rescue bid. \nIn justifying the all-stock bid, Chuck Watson, chairman of Dynegy, said last week that buying the company for a low price - a fraction of Enron's market capitalisation at its peak in 2000 - was a major protection against failure. \nBut he admitted that much of the last round of negotiations with Moody's had been spent reassuring them that the material adverse change clauses in the merger agreement were not too loose. \nAccording to Dynegy, the material adverse change clauses relate to the outcome of a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into Enron's finances, possible litigation against the energy company, balance sheet strength and earnings forecasts. www.ft.com/enron. \n(c) Copyright Financial Times Ltd.

Enron delayed releasing the 10-Q by five days and said the filing made Monday had not been fully audited by its accounting firm, Andersen, because of an ongoing investigation by the company's board of directors and the need for more time. \n\"We are continuing to review the transactions in question and are making progress with our investigation,\" said William K. Powers Jr., chairman of Enron's special investigation committee and dean of the University of Texas School of Law. \nEnron's pending $690 million IOU is related to a limited partnership to buy natural gas assets in Brazil. One of the terms of the partnership requires Enron to repay the debt if its credit rating slips to BBB- on rating agency Standard & Poor's scale, which it did Nov. 12. If Enron doesn't put up collateral equal to the amount of the note or repay it, the other partners in the deal can sell off the partnership's assets. \nEnron officials said in the filing they are working with lenders to come up with an acceptable agreement on the debt. \nIf Enron's debt rating continues to drop, which would put it below investment grade, the company would face another $3.9 billion in debt repayments, the company said in the filing, mainly by two other partnerships formed in recent years: $2.4 billion owed by Osprey Trust and $915 million by Marlin Water Trust. \nEnron is under a negative review by most rating agencies, but a cash infusion from Dynegy combined with additional lines of credit from a number of investment banks and a possible $500 million to $1 billion equity investment by other investors is expected to keep the ratings afloat. \nThe turmoil around Enron's finances started after Oct. 16, when steep losses in its third-quarter earnings drew renewed attention to a pair of investment partnerships created by the former chief financial officer with the approval of the company's board of directors. \nThe LJM partnerships were formed using Enron equity and outside capital as a way to hedge against the risks involved in some of the company's new lines of business and were designed to help the company grow quickly without adding too much debt to its books or diluting the value of the company's stock. \nThe CFO's dual roles as a company executive and managing director of the entities prompted an SEC investigation as well as an internal Enron investigation that led the company to cut its earnings over the past 4 1/2 years by nearly $600 million. \nThose problems shook investor and trading partner confidence in Enron, which led to a sharp drop in its stock price and cuts in its credit rating. The company eventually reached a deal with rival Dynegy to be acquired for almost $9 billion in stock plus the assumption of almost $13 billion in debt and $2 billion in preferred stock. \nThe fallout from Enron's crumble is spreading to its major service providers, including Andersen. That firm has been named as a defendant in at least one shareholder lawsuit, while on Monday Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., called for an investigation of Andersen in connection with its audits of Enron and Houston-based Waste Management. \n\"The best accounting standards in the world are meaningless if the accounting and audit processes are so inept or corrupt that they produce unreliable numbers and untruthful reporting,\" Dingell wrote in a letter to the Public Oversight Board requesting the investigation. \nAndersen, based in Chicago, has a large Houston office and a strong foothold in the energy industry with clients, including Enron and Dynegy. Critics of Andersen have said the firm should have done more as Enron's auditor to draw investors' attention to the company's unusual finances. \nA lawsuit filed in Oregon alleged Andersen's judgment was swayed by lucrative consulting fees that it received from Enron while it was auditor. \nIn June, Andersen was fined $7 million by the SEC to settle charges that it filed false and misleading audit reports of Waste Management, the largest civil penalty against a Big Five accounting firm. Andersen did not admit or deny the charges. \nReuters News Service contributed to this story. \n\n\nBankers concerned Dynergy may abandon Enron deal - report\n\n11/20/2001\nAFX News\n(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd\nLONDON (AFX) - Senior Wall Street bankers are concerned Dynergy Inc could walk away from its proposed rescue bid for its rival energy group Enron Corp, reports the Financial Times without citing sources. \nThe FT says bankers are worried the company could trigger the \"material adverse change\" clause in the deal.\nmps/mkp For more information and to contact AFX: www.afxnews.com and www.afxpress.com\n\n\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

That would put its loss at 87 cents a share.\n\n\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

John D. Dingell (D-Mich.) asked the Public Oversight Board for a \"review or special investigation of Arthur Andersen LLP,\" said the letter.\nDingell also asked the board to look into peer reviews of Arthur Andersen conducted in recent years by other accounting firms, including Deloitte & Touche, and questioned the value of a triennial peer review process in place since 1978. \nArthur Andersen, based in Chicago, was auditor to Houston energy trading giant Enron, rocked in recent weeks by a Securities and Exchange Commission probe of outside partnership deals involving company officers. Enron's stock price has plunged, several managers have resigned and numerous shareholder lawsuits are pending.\n\n\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. \t\nU.S. Official Calls for Probe Of Andersen, 2 Problem Audits\nBy Judith Burns\nDow Jones Newswires\n\n11/20/2001\nThe Wall Street Journal Europe\n22\n(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)\nWASHINGTON -- Concerned about the accounting profession's ability to police itself, a senior House of Representatives Democrat has called for a \"special investigation\" of Arthur Andersen LLP and its audits of Enron Corp. and Waste Management Inc. \nIn a letter to U.S. Public Oversight Board Chairman Charles Bowsher released Monday, Rep. John Dingell, a Michigan Democrat, requested a review of Andersen's audits of Enron and Waste Management, two high-profile audit failures.\nEnron, of Houston, which recently agreed to be acquired by crosstown rival Dynergy Inc., acknowledged it overstated net income by $586 million (662.5 million euros) and will need to restate financial reports dating back to 1997. \nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating Enron's treatment of investments in limited partnerships tied to former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow. \nEnron's problems come on the heels of another audit debacle for Andersen. In June, the firm reached a $7 million settlement with the SEC in which it neither admitted nor denied allegations of fraud in its audit of Waste Management. \nAndersen and the waste hauler paid $220 million in 1999 to settle class-action lawsuits alleging massive accounting fraud that inflated Waste Management's reported earnings in the mid-1990s. \nIn addition to the SEC's probe of its role in the Enron matter, Andersen is undergoing routine peer review by Deloitte & Touche. Dingell suggested that review may be clouded by the fact that Deloitte & Touche has been hired by outside lawyers representing a special committee of Enron's board of directors. \nGiven the potential conflict of interest on the part of Deloitte & Touche, and Andersen's track record, \"there appears to be little reason for the public to have faith in Andersen or the peer review process,\" Mr. Dingell wrote.\n\n\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Dunham\n\n11/20/2001\nThe Wall Street Journal\nB10\n(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)\n[Focus on Retirement, Pay and Getting Ahead] \nPassing Up\nSome senior executives are spurning hefty severance packages. \nLast week, Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth Lay decided to forgo a $60.6 million severance payment that would have been triggered by Dynegy Inc.'s planned acquisition of the Houston energy trader. Enron initially said Mr. Lay would keep one-third of the planned payout and take it in shares of the combined company. He later decided against any severance payment after criticism by influential energy traders, who produce most of Enron's profits. \n\"In this environment, we're seeing producers putting pressure on managers and managers putting pressure on producers to ensure that their pay is in line with their performance,\" says Ira Kay, executive-compensation practice leader of pay-and-benefits consultants Watson Wyatt Worldwide in New York. \nAlan Johnson, managing director of New York pay consultants Johnson Associates, says Mr. Lay's initial intention to accept a portion of his severance represents \"the continuing trend of executives being clueless.\" \n(For the 12 months ended Aug. 31, Mr. Lay received about $70 million from exercising Enron stock options, according to disclosure reports tracked by Thomson Financial.) \nThree top executives of US Airways Group Inc., including Chief Executive Rakesh Gangwal and Chairman Stephen Wolf, passed up severance after deciding to stay at the company when a planned merger fell through. The trio stood to gain $45 million for resigning as a result of severance agreements triggered by shareholder approval of its now-defunct merger accord with UAL Corp. At US Airways' Sept. 19 annual meeting, they said they would remain with the company. \nFirm Relationship \nNew York law firm Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft last week rolled out an unusual formal mentoring program for first-year associates. \nFor two hours a month for at least a year, each associate will meet with a designated mentor -- typically a midlevel associate -- to discuss issues such as career development. If the relationship doesn't click, new pairings will be made. CWT hires about 50 law-school graduates a year. \nJordan Schwartz, the firm's hiring partner, says the initiative was sparked by a 2000 survey of midlevel associates at 165 U.S. law firms conducted by American Lawyer magazine. The poll, which assesses how associates perceive they are being treated, ranked the firm last. \"It wasn't an accurate reflection of the firm,\" he says. \"But it was a wake-up call.\" \nSo, CWT created an \"associate task force\" that identified key issues and explored ways to improve the quality of work life. The mentoring program was one result. \nHiring Blitz \nDespite rising joblessness, a few employers are hiring in a big way. \nZipRealty Inc., an online real-estate broker in Richmond, Calif., recently announced plans to hire 1,000 real-estate agents within the next 18 months. It has about 135 agents, all of whom work from home. \n\"We have large consumer demands right now, so we want to make sure we have great realtors,\" says Scott Kucirek, executive vice president of people and culture. \nSince August, zipRealty has hired nearly 30 agents a month for all its 12 markets, which include Los Angeles, Phoenix, San Diego and Chicago. The company has three full-time recruiters sending e-mails and making calls to market its recruitment effort. Its database contains 200 to 300 prospects. \nThe job, which usually pays only commission, offers some perks. The company will pay new agents $1,500 a month for three months to give them time to make connections and sell a home. After that, pay will be entirely commission based. New hires also receive cellphone and car allowances. \n--- \nE-mail comments to Kemba.Dunham@wsj.com\n\n\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

OPPEL Jr. and FLOYD NORRIS\n\n11/20/2001\nThe New York Times\nPage 1, Column 2\nc. 2001 New York Times Company\nThe Enron Corporation told investors yesterday that it faced debt repayments over the next year vastly in excess of its available cash. It said that if any of a number of things went wrong, its ability to continue as a going concern would be called into question. \nIn a delayed quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company said that it would have to repay $690 million in debt by next Tuesday if it did not come up with collateral for a loan.\nEnron has about $1.75 billion in cash and credit lines now available but faces debt repayments and other obligations of $9.15 billion by the end of next year. The report for the third quarter, which was filed five days late, says the company faces immediate demand for $3.9 billion in debts if its credit rating is downgraded any further. \nEnron's independent auditors with the firm of Arthur Andersen have not been able to complete their review of Enron's financial statements for the third quarter. Andersen already faces lawsuits over its audits of Enron's books related to Enron's disclosure this month that it had overstated almost $600 million in profits in the last five years. Enron has said that it will restate statements that Andersen certified and that those statements should no longer be relied upon. \nYesterday, Representative John D. Dingell of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, called for an investigation into Arthur Andersen's handling of the Enron audits. A spokesman for Andersen could not be reached last night. \nEnron, the nation's largest energy trader, has agreed to be acquired by Dynegy Inc., its smaller crosstown rival in Houston, and credit rating agencies have said that a failure of that deal to go through would lead to a further downgrading of Enron, which is now at the lowest investment-grade rating. Any downgrades could lead to a collapse of Enron's core energy trading business, analysts say, as other energy trading companies might stop doing business with Enron entirely. \nThe Dynegy deal is expected to close sometime next year, and the disclosures yesterday indicate that Enron may face challenges in meeting its obligations before then, particularly if the closing of the deal is delayed. Enron said it hoped to complete the transaction by the end of next September. \nEnron is in talks to obtain $500 million to $1 billion in additional financing through an equity infusion from major banks and institutions. In addition, executives have said they are hoping to close deals to sell $800 million in assets by the end of the year, and perhaps a few billion dollars of assets next year. Enron is also set to receive a $1 billion infusion from ChevronTexaco, which owns a 27 percent stake in Dynegy, if the deal closes next year. \nStill, even after factoring in cash flow from Enron's core energy-trading operations, Enron could be left well short of what it needs to satisfy the huge obligations due by the end of next year -- meaning that Enron will probably have to work to persuade bankers to restructure debts or extend maturities. \nCarol Coale, an analyst for Prudential Securities in Houston, said the new disclosures indicated that Enron's troubles had run deeper than what investors and analysts believed, even as the stock crashed early this month before the merger with Dynegy was announced. \n''Our initial read was that this might have been like a run on the bank,'' Ms. Coale said. ''But now it sounds like Enron's problems were actually more inherent than perceived.'' \nEnron's deal with Dynegy calls for Enron holders to receive 0.2685 Dynegy share for each Enron share, but in trading since the deal was announced Enron's share price has lagged Dynegy's price, reflecting investor doubts that the deal will be completed at the announced terms. \nIn New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, before the Enron filing was released, Enron rose 6 cents, to $9.06, and Dynegy rose $1.13, to $43.60. At those prices, the value of the Dynegy offer is 29.2 percent above Enron's share price, compared with a 20.6 percent difference when the deal was announced. \nSome debts that Enron might have to pay quickly if its bond rating is lowered could be satisfied by selling shares, but such sales would probably reduce the stock price further. And the merger agreement with Dynegy provides that the exchange ratio would be reduced if Enron sold stock at prices below the implied value under the merger -- currently $11.71 an Enron share. \nIn after-hours trading yesterday, after the release of the Enron filing, the share price slipped to $9. \nEnron had previously said it was reducing its profits taken in previous years by more than $500 million. Yesterday's filing provided some additional details on Enron's relationships with various related partnerships whose debts Enron could be forced to pay, and it said that additional write-offs could come as early as the current quarter if it concluded that asset values in the partnerships had declined. It said that because Enron's stock value had fallen, one write-down could be $700 million. \nThe disclosures show that Enron erected complicated financial structures that in some cases seem to have been meant to allow the company to avoid taking losses on assets and in other cases were aimed at keeping debts off its balance sheet. \nBut the collapse of Enron's stock price has both worsened the situation for some of those entities and greatly increased the cost Enron would face if it needed to pay off the debts. \n''It is not possible to predict,'' Enron warned investors, whether its asset sales or debt refinancings would be successful. ''An adverse outcome with respect to any of these matters would likely have a material adverse impact on Enron's ability to continue as a going concern.''\n\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\nHOUSTON (AP) - The decision to base the oil giant created by the combination of Phillips Petroleum Co. and Conoco Inc. in Houston, home of the smaller Conoco, helps cement the city's status as the nation's energy capital. \n\"Houston already was the energy capital of the world. This just proves it,\" said Mark Baxter, director of the Maguire Energy Institute at Southern Methodist University in Dallas.\n\"All the major players are in Houston and Houston can accommodate the employee growth base,\" he said. \"It is easier to conduct the business in the Houston market because not only are all the major companies there, all the support is in Houston as well.\" \nThe dlrs 15.6 billion deal announced Sunday that would create the nation's third largest oil producer may mean more prestige for Houston, even though the nation's two largest oil companies - Irving-based ExxonMobil and San Francisco-based ChevronTexaco - have their headquarters located elsewhere, each has thousands of employees working in the nation's fourth-largest city. \nIt all began with the 1901 Spindletop strike in southeast Texas when oilmen discovered that much of the continental United States' vast oil resources lay beneath Texas soil. \n\"Historically oil and gas centers sprang up adjacent to oil and gas discoveries,\" said David Bole, the vice president of Randall & Dewey, Inc., a Houston-based oil consulting firm. \"But certainly with high-speed communications developed over the last 30 years, the decision making has been centralized more in the financial centers. \n\"What has set Houston apart from many other emerging oil centers was the caliber of the early wildcatters, their vision and their ability to build mega-companies. In many cases it is their legacy that has built Houston into today's oil capital.\" \nShell Oil Co. is based in Houston alongside several other producers and numerous offshore drilling, oil field services, pipeline, oil field firefighting and related companies. \nIn recent years, the city also has become home to large energy trading firms such as Dynegy, Inc., Enron Corp., Reliant Inc. and others. Together, they operate dozens of computerized energy trading floors scattered throughout the city. \n\"Consolidation is cumulative - a self-fulfilling process of centralizing all the important pieces of the oil industry in one place,\" Bill Gilmer, an economist in Houston for the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, wrote in a recent publication. \"The same principles, of course, are what draw moviemakers to Hollywood, financial service providers to New York and automakers to Detroit.\" \nAnd, it seems, energy companies to Houston.\n\n\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

All Rights Reserved\nChevronTexaco yesterday increased the annual savings it expected to achieve from the merger between the two oil groups to $1.8bn by March 2003. \nDavid O'Reilly, chief executive, told analysts that the combined company would also meet its original synergy target of $1.2bn within six to nine months of the deal, which was completed last month.\nMr O'Reilly also said it expected oil and gas production to grow at an annual rate of 2.5 to 3 per cent over the next five years, and dismissed worries about the falling oil price. \n\"Our business is used to swings and volatility - if you want a stable price environment you don't want to be in this business,\" he told reporters after addressing analysts in New York. \nMr O'Reilly said the news of the latest big merger in the industry - the $35bn deal between Conoco and Phillips Petroleum - only made him more confident that the ChevronTexaco deal was right. \nChevronTexaco now claims to be the third-largest energy company in terms of global oil reserves and the fourth-largest in global oil and natural gas production. He said the synergies translated into gains of about $1 per share after tax. \nChevronTexaco has an important role in Dynegy's rescue bid for Enron, the rival energy group. ChevronTexaco has a 26 per cent stake in Dynegy and immediately invested $1.5bn in convertible preferred shares of Dynegy to fund its direct equity infusion in Enron. ChevronTexaco is committed to buying a further $1bn of Dynegy common stock once Dynegy completes its takeover. If the deal fails, ChevronTexaco can redeem the convertible preferred shares for $1.5bn in cash or convert to common shares, giving it a 36 per cent stake in equity. \nMr O'Reilly said yesterday the group was committed to the deal, despite worries about potential hidden liabilities at Enron. \nChevronTexaco is doing its own review of potential litigation risks at Enron, and Mr O'Reilly said there was \"a full suite of due diligence\" that needed to be done on other issues at Enron. \n* Enron's lenders welcomed the energy company's openness yesterday following a meeting in New York. Greg Whalley, Enron's president, led the meeting, which was postponed when Dynegy began talks with Enron two weeks ago. \n\"Much of senior management was there and they were doing a good job,\" said one. Another banker said Enron management had been \"pretty upfront\" about the problems at the company, although he said most lenders were reluctant to air their concerns in full at the crowded meeting. \n(c) Copyright Financial Times Ltd.

Bryson Hull\n\n11/19/2001\nReuters English News Service\n(C) Reuters Limited 2001.\nHOUSTON, Nov 19 (Reuters) - Humbled energy giant Enron Corp. on Monday warned that it could be forced to pay a $690 million debt by next week and reduced its already-abysmal third-quarter earnings. \nThe Houston company sounded the debt and credit alarms once again in a filing made on Monday with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nAmong the new information included is the disclosure that Enron is up against a short deadline to meet a $690 million debt obligation triggered by a credit downgrade last week. That marked the start of a nine-day period that expires on Nov. 26, during which Enron must lay down collateral against the debt owed to a third party in one of its myriad partnerships. \nIf not, the partner has the right to liquidate all of the assets of the partnership, which includes a Brazilian natural gas company that Enron was counting on selling to raise $250 million in cash. \nThe company is working to make alternative payment arrangements, since it can ill-afford to pay the debt now. Enron has already already maxed out its $3 billion credit line, secured roughly $2 billion in loans and is looking for more cash to stay afloat. \nEnron also reduced previously reported 2001 third-quarter earnings by 3 cents per share and increased previously reported earnings for the first 9 months of the year by a penny per share. The move reflects adjustments made after the quarter's end, Enron said. \nOn Oct. 16, Enron reported a loss of $638 million or 84 cents per share for the third quarter of 2001. On Nov 8, Enron said it had restated earnings for 1997-2000 and that net income for the four-year period was more than a half a billion lower than originally reported. \nIt also warned that a further drop in its credit rating could force it to pay $3.9 billion to other partnerships, the bulk of it to Osprey Trust and Marlin Water Trust. \nSuch an outcome would keep Enron from paying its revolving credit accounts and \"would likely have a material adverse impact on Enron's ability to continue as a going concern,\" the company wrote. \nEnron had released those figures earlier, but had yet to state in such stark terms the dire risk the debts pose to its viability. \nCREDIT COULD BE A KILLER \nMoody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's this month cut their respective senior unsecured debt ratings for Enron to \"Baa3\" and \"BBB-minus,\" just one notch above \"junk\" status. Each warned it may cut its respective ratings again. Moody's also cut Enron's short-term debt rating, which affects commercial paper, to \"Not Prime,\" a junk rating. \nIn nearly all of its partnership deals, Enron guaranteed the financing it received with a promise to issue Enron shares to its partners if its credit fell below investment grade and its stock price was under certain levels. At the close of trading Monday on the New York Stock Exchange, Enron shares were at $9.06 - well below the trigger prices. \nAll of the partnerships, which Enron used to finance projects in a way that kept them off the balance sheet, have become the once-proud company's bane. The SEC is investigating potential conflict-of-interest issues involving two such partnerships on which ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow served as general partner. \nEnron had to extract itself from those partnerships, which led to a $1.2 billion reduction in Enron shareholder equity. \nThe revelation of the equity reduction started one of the more stunning and rapid corporate collapses in recent memory, leaving Enron to be bought on Nov. 9 by smaller cross-town rival Dynegy Inc. for the fire-sale price of $9 billion in stock. \nIn an unusual note, Enron said that its financial statements in the filing were not audited by an independent accountant, per SEC regulations, because of \"the need of Arthur Andersen LLP, Enron's independent auditors, to complete their review procedures.\" \nArthur Andersen had no comment, but Enron said the ongoing investigation by a special committee appointed by Enron's board of directors to look into its partnership dealings precludes the audit's completion. \n(Additional reporting by Andrew Kelly in Houston and Jonathan Stempel in New York).\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. \t\n\nEnron Warns That Raft of Problems May Hurt Its Fourth-Quarter Profit\n\n11/19/2001\nDow Jones Business News\n(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)\nEnron Corp. warned that continuing credit worries, a decline in the value of some of its assets and reduced trading activity could hurt its fourth-quarter earnings, Tuesday's Wall Street Journal reported. \nThe energy company said it may be forced to take a $700 million pretax hit to earnings due to a plunge in the value of assets held by one of its investment partnerships. The partnership, Whitewing LLP, held assets with a book value of $4.7 billion on Nov. 16 but a drop in the value of Enron (ENE) stock held by the partnership could result in a derivative loss of $700 million, the company said.\nIn addition, Enron, Houston, said it may have to come up with more money to honor a collateral call on a $690 million note. That note became a \"demand obligation,\" on Nov. 12, when Enron's credit rating got lowered to triple-B-minus by Standard & Poor's. The company didn't disclose who holds the note. \n\"We've got nine days to either repay the note or post a letter of credit or they can start liquidating assets,\" said company spokesman Mark Palmer. One of the assets includes C.E.G. Rio, a gas distribution company in Brazil that Enron already is in the process of selling and whose proceeds it had intended to use for other forms of debt reduction. The company said it is trying to negotiate a waiver or extension of the credit provision with lenders to preserve its cash. \nEnron has set up a number of partnerships over the years to hedge investment risks and, in some cases, to keep debt off its balance sheet. In the wake of a Securities and Exchange Commission formal probe into its accounting and disclosure practices launched Oct. 31, the company restated its earnings downward dating back to 1997 and has consolidated some debt back onto its balance sheet. \nThe company on Nov. 9 agreed to merge with competitor Dynegy Inc. (DYN). But its latest SEC filing said it was sued by shareholders on Nov. 12 in state court in Houston to prevent the merger from happening. The petition alleges that Enron's directors breached their fiduciary duties to Enron's shareholders by agreeing to sell Enron for inadequate consideration and without an adequate investigation of the alternatives available to Enron. Enron said it would vigorously defend itself. \nMonday's filing included numerous changes in previously reported numbers for revenues and expenses. In its original third-quarter statement, the company reported a loss of $618 million. The stated loss was increased to $635 million last week and in the latest filing, the loss for the quarter ended Sept. 30 was widened to $664 million. \nEnron added that the numbers contained in latest filing aren't necessarily final because its external auditor, Arthur Andersen, hasn't completed its review, nor has an internal audit committee finished reviewing the firm's accounting practices. \nCopyright (c) 2001 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. \nAll Rights Reserved.\n\n\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

(ENE) filed its Form 10-Q for the third quarter and said its previously reported third quarter loss of 84 cents a share was widened by 3 cents to reflect adjustments made subsequent to the end of the quarter. \nAs reported, Enron was restating financial statements from 1997 through the second quarter of 2001 due to questions over its finances.\nOn Oct. 16, Enron reported a loss of $618 million on revenue of $47.6 billion for the third quarter ended Sept. 30. \nIn a press release Monday, the company said its earnings of 19 cents a share for the nine-month period of 2001 were increased by 1 cent a share. \n\nEnron said its independent auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP, hasn't finalized its review of the company's financial statements in accordance with established professional standards because of the ongoing investigation by the special committee of the board and the need for Andersen to complete its review procedures. \nIn the third quarter, Enron wrote off more than $1 billion related to its failed investments and reduced shareholder equity by about $1.2 billion to unwind an off-balance financing vehicle once run by its former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. That relationship is being examined in a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation, and is the center of more than a dozen shareholder lawsuits. \nAccording to the company's Form 10-Q, the special committee's investigation may identify additional or different information concerning these matters, which would require additional or different restatements. \n\nDow Jones Corporate Filings Alert reported Monday that Enron is currently preparing a restructuring plan aimed at taking aggressive steps to rationalize the company's existing cost structure, accelerating the process of divesting non-core businesses and assets and restructuring scheduled maturities of debt and other obligations. \nEnron said it is unable to estimate the timing of restructuring or the financial impact, but said fourth quarter results of operations will likely be hurt by employee severance, restructuring and other charges, according to Corporate Filings Alert. \nThe company had $1 billion in cash and cash equivalents at Sept. 30. \nOn Nov. 9, Enron and Dynegy Inc. (DYN) signed a definitive merger agreement that would give Enron shareholders 0.2685 share of a Dynegy share. The merger is expected to close by the end of the third quarter of 2002. \n-Stephen Lee; Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-5400\n\n\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

All Rights Reserved.\nKATHLEEN HAYS, CNNFN ANCHOR, MARKETS IMPACT: There are mounting fears about the fate of the Enron (URL: http://.www.enron.com/) /Dynegy (URL: http://www.dynegy.com/) deal. Financial Times once again has a scoop. Robert Thomson is the U.S. Managing Editor of the FT joining us now with details. Robert what`s going on I thought this was suppose to be a done deal? \nROBERT THOMSON, FINANCIAL TIMES, U.S. MANAGING EDITOR: Well that`s right Kathleen but the interesting thing that make it perhaps not so done a deal is what we might call the materially adverse clause. That there is a change in the conditions surrounding Enron that makes (INAUDIBLE) a downgrade of them possible and really leaves the financial institutions exposed to them. And these financial institutions in conversations interviews with the Financial Times are telling us that they have deeper fears about this materially adverse clause being enacted than people out there now realize.\nHAYS: Well I must say I think this is very interesting and I`m surprised not that I`m an expert on the deal or even close to the deal itself but it seemed that part of the way that Enron was getting the deal done with Dynegy was to say look we dug up all the possible problems all the maybe kind of hidden not so great deals that are being investigated now and supposedly everything was on the table. So what, what do you think? What are you hearing that they`re finding now that makes things look worst than they already look? \nTHOMSON: Well really that`s the issue. To be quite honest we don`t know but who would have known a month ago and particularly three months ago that Enron is in this situation that it`s now in and how far those problems stretch is really the issue that (INAUDIBLE) surrounding Enron still have it and that they suspect that Dynegy might have it. It looks quite more (INAUDIBLE) the deal. Now Dynegy is saying but we`re going ahead with this yes there is that clause there, yes it covers us in case we find something that we don`t like the look of or like the smell of depending on what it maybe but we don`t` feel it will have to activate it. But of course on the other hand they are going to say that but they do have that fall back clause if they need it. \nHAYS: Go ahead Robert I`m sorry. \nTHOMSON: So, but the truth is you know the full extent of Enron`s exposure to various businesses really is hidden by the complexity of the transaction`s the company was engaging in markets where frankly very few people know a lot about it. \nHAYS: What happens if the deal falls through? What happen to Enron? \nTHOMSON: Well there`s a real issue there that a downgrade may follow and this there`s certainly concern in the banking community. Again, that the level of exposure in counter party risk and so on to Enron isn`t fully comprehended and frankly that`s why they spoke to the Financial Times because they thought well there`s an impression that this is a done deal, that the Enron problem is solved. They`re saying actually not so. \nHAYS: Wow. Well I think we have just enough time to take a look at you`re you got us something in China again. You take us to that world part of the world frequently what`s going on there. \nTHOMSON: Yeah we Beijing (INAUDIBLE) here. Essentially the IFC the International Finance Corporation arm of the World Bank is taking a large stake in Chinese Bank in Nanjing (ph). That is amazing really. It`s by far the largest stake, $27 million, 15 percent in the Nanjing(ph) City Bank and it`s really we here are going to be the first of three big investments in Chinese banks over the next year or so. There are two small ones there already where people have taken 3, 5 percent in Chinese banks but for the first time International institutions are in a position where they can think about Chinese retail banking in a serious way. \nHAYS: OK Robert well thank you very much I guess that`s something for investors to watch. Particularly people who are global investors. \nNEW INTERVIEW: NEW INTERVIEW: \nKATHLEEN HAYS, CNNfn ANCHOR, MARKETS IMPACT: \nTO ORDER A VIDEO OF THIS TRANSCRIPT, PLEASE CALL 888-CNNFN-01 OR USE OUR SECURE ONLINE ORDER FORM LOCATED AT WWW.FDCH.COM \nTHIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT.

That's when Enron lowered its earnings back\nto 1997 by $586 million, reflecting losses by affiliated\npartnerships that it had wrongly kept off the books.\n\n     ``I don't think anyone would be particularly surprised that\nthey had to adjust third-quarter earnings (again) considering they\nrestated earnings for the last four years,'' said Olson, who\ndoesn't own shares of Dynegy or Enron. ``I don't think it's a\nproblem.''\n\n     Making good on debt owed by its Whitewing partnership may cut\nEnron's fourth-quarter earnings. Enron is obligated to back\nWhitewing by issuing junior convertible preferred stock. Because\nEnron's stock has plunged, it may have to write down its assets by\n$700 million, the filing said.\n\n                       Partnership Problems\n\n     Enron said that the Dynegy buyout could collapse if Enron is\nforced to pay judgments of more than $2 billion to settle lawsuits\nover its dealings with affiliated partnerships. Dynegy has said it\ncan cancel the transaction if Enron's litigation costs and other\nliabilities grow to $3.5 billion or more. Enron faces at least 23\nsuch lawsuits.\n\n     Enron used affiliated partnerships to raise money quickly and\ntake debt off its books. Its shares plunged by 89 percent this\nyear as investors questioned whether the partnerships also were\nbeing used to hide losses from failed investments.\n\n     Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay said earlier this month\nthat buying back 62 million shares from two such partnerships cost\nEnron shareholders $1.2 billion in lost equity. The company wrote\noff $1.01 billion in investments in water, telecommunications and\nretail-energy sales in the third quarter.\n\n     A drop in Enron's senior unsecured debt rating to ``BBB-'' by\nStandard & Poor's on Nov. 12 may force Enron to pay off the $690\nmillion note by Nov. 27 if it doesn't find collateral to guarantee\nthe debt taken on by another affiliated partnership, the company\nsaid.\n\n                        Brazilian Liability\n\n     Without repayment or collateral, investors in a partnership\nthat owns Brazilian natural-gas assets can begin to liquidate the\npartnership's assets, Enron said. Enron said it's working with\nlenders to come up with an acceptable agreement on the debt.\n\n     ``If we can't talk lenders into refinancing, there is the\npossibility that . . . note would be due next week,'' said Karen\nDenne, an Enron spokeswoman.\n\n     As of Friday, the company had $1.3 billion in cash on hand.\nIt expects to close on $450 million in additional financing\ntomorrow, and to complete $800 million in asset sales by the end\nof the year. It's also trying to find investors who will put $500\nmillion to $1 billion into the company.\n\n     The company has raised cash in recent weeks by using its\npipelines as collateral. It received $1.5 billion from\nChevronTexaco last week as part of the Dynegy buyout agreement. In\nreturn, Dynegy acquired preferred stock and other rights in an\nEnron unit that owns the Northern Natural Gas pipeline. Dynegy can\nacquire the pipeline even if the merger falls through.\n\n     Enron closed on a $550 million loan from J.P. Morgan Chase &\nCo. and Salomon Smith Barney Inc. on Wednesday that was secured\nwith assets of Enron's Transwestern Pipeline Co. It expects to\nclose on another $450 million loan, secured with other Northern\nNatural Gas assets, this week, Denne said. The commitment for the\nloans was announced Nov. 1.\n\n\n                      $3.9 Billion Liability\n\n     The company also has huge liabilities that could push it into\nfinancial crisis before the merger closes. A further drop in its\ndebt rating, which would put it below investment grade, would\ntrigger repayment of $3.9 billion in debt owed by two other\naffiliated companies, Enron said.\n\n     The rating drop would force it to repay $2.4 billion in debt\nowed by Osprey Trust, and $915 million in debt taken on by Marlin\nWater Trust, the company said in the filing.\n\n     Arthur Andersen LLP, Enron's auditor, didn't grant final\napproval of its financial statements in the filing because of an\ninternal investigation of its dealings with affiliated\npartnerships, Enron said. The SEC is also investigating the\npartnerships, which were run by Enron executives.\n\n     The filing was released after the stock market closed. Shares\nof Enron rose 6 cents to $9.06. Dynegy rose $1.13 to $43.60.\nChevronTexaco Corp., which owns 26 percent of Dynegy and is\nproviding $2.5 billion in cash as part of the Enron buyout, fell\n54 cents to $82.91.\n\n\nChevronTexaco Sees Investor Suits as Threat to Enron (Update1)\n2001-11-19 19:53 (New York)\n\nChevronTexaco Sees Investor Suits as Threat to Enron (Update1)\n\n     (Updates with Enron reducing third-quarter results in last\nparagraph.)\n\n     New York, Nov. 19 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s exposure to\ninvestor lawsuits is the biggest hurdle in its proposed buyout by\nDynegy Inc., said David O'Reilly, chief executive officer of\nChevronTexaco Inc., which is helping to back Dynegy's purchase.\n\n     ChevronTexaco is ``paying particular attention to the\nlitigation risk,'' though ``we still think it's a good deal for\nDynegy and an even better deal for ChevronTexaco,'' Reilly said at\nan analyst meeting in New York.\n\n     ChevronTexaco, the second-biggest U.S. oil company, owns 27\npercent of Dynegy. It agreed to provide Dynegy $2.5 billion as\npart of the Enron purchase. Dynegy can cancel the bid if Enron's\nlegal liabilities, including investor suits, exceed $3.5 billion.\nEnron said today in a regulatory filing it can't calculate the\ncost of shareholder suits.\n\n     Dynegy agreed 10 days ago to buy rival Enron, the largest\nenergy trader, for stock and debt now valued at $20.7 billion.\nEnron's stock had plunged in recent weeks because of concerns it\nwas using affiliated partnerships to mask losses and hide debt.\n\n     Gold Bennett Cera & Sidner LLP filed a class action suit in\nHouston today alleging Enron misrepresented its business and\nresults. Other investors have filed similar suits.\n\n     ChevronTexaco will have a clearer picture of the legal risks\nin the next few months, O'Reilly said. ``There is no transaction\nthat is risk free,'' he said.\n\n     Shares of Enron rose 6 cents to $9.06 today. They have\ntumbled 89 percent this year. Dynegy gained $1.13 to $43.60. The\nstock has declined 22 percent this year. Both companies are based\nin Houston.\n\n     ChenvronTexaco, based in San Francisco, fell 54 cents to\n$82.91.\n\n     Earlier this month, Enron reduced its earnings in the past\nfour years by $552 million because of accounting errors involving\naffiliates. Enron ousted its chief financial officer, and it fired\nits treasurer and a company attorney for making improper\ninvestments in one of the affiliates.\n\n     Enron reduced third-quarter earnings for a second time and\nsaid it may have to make early payment on a $690 million note\nthis month, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and\nExchange Commission.\n\n\n\n\nEnron Says It May Have to Pay Off $690 Mln Note Next Week\n2001-11-19 18:16 (New York)\n\nEnron Says It May Have to Pay Off $690 Mln Note Next Week\n\n     Houston, Nov. 19 (Bloomberg) -- Enron said a drop in its\ncredit rating may force it to pay off a $690 million note by Nov.\n27 if it doesn't find collateral to guarantee the debt.\n\n     Repayment was triggered by the Nov. 12 downgrade in Enron's\nsenior unsecured debt rating to BBB- by Standard & Poor's, the\ncompany said in a securities filing.\n\n     Enron must post collateral equal to the amount of the note or\nrepay it, the Securities and Exchange Commission filing said.\n\n    Without repayment, partners in a Limited Partnership that owns\nnatural gas assets in Brazil can immediately begin to liquidate\nthe partnership's assets, Enron said. Enron said it's working with\nlenders to come up with an acceptable agreement on the debt.\n\n     A further drop in its debt rating, which would put it below\ninvestment grade, would trigger repayment of $3.9 billion in debt\nowed by two affiliated companies.\n\n     The rating drop would trigger repayment of $2.4 billion in\ndebt owed by Osprey Trust, and $915 million owed by Marlin Water\nTrust, the company said in the filing.\n\n     Enron is being bought by Dynegy Inc. for $25 billion in stock\nand debt. Enron also said in its filing that if shareholder\nlawsuits result in judgments totaling more than $2 billion, the\nDynegy deal could collapse.\n\n    The filing was released after the stock market closed.  Shares\nof Houston-based Enron rose 6 cents to $9.06. Dynegy shares rose\n$1.13 to $43.60. Shares of ChevronTexaco Corp., which owns 26\npercent of Dynegy, fell 54 cents to $82.91.\n\n\n\nEnron's Azurix May Have to Sell Assets If It Can't Borrow\n2001-11-19 14:35 (New York)\n\nEnron's Azurix May Have to Sell Assets If It Can't Borrow\n\n     Houston, Nov. 19 (Bloomberg) -- Azurix Corp., Enron Corp.'s\nwater unit, may have to sell assets if it can't find financing to\ncontinue operations, the company said in a regulatory filing.\n\n     Enron took Azurix public in June 1999 and then, after the\nwater company's stock plunged, took it private and paid off\ninvestors in March.\n\n     Azurix isn't sure it will be able to renew or refinance about\n$113.3 million in long-term debt, including bank loans, that\nmatures before Sept. 30 at a ``reasonable'' cost, it said in a\nfiling with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The\ncompany also had $326.3 million in short-term debt as of Sept. 30.\n\n     The loans are Azurix's ``primary sources of liquidity,'' the\nfiling said. If the company can't raise the funds, it might have\nto use the proceeds from planned asset sales to refinance debt and\nget cash, the filing said.\n\n     If those asset sales don't generate enough money, ``Azurix\nmay need to sell other assets, which could result in Azurix\nincurring losses in future periods,'' the company said.\n\n     Azurix, though it still must file with the SEC, no longer\ntrades as a separate stock. The shares of Houston-based Enron fell\n8 cents to $8.92 in early afternoon trading.\n\n     Enron agreed earlier this month to be acquired by rival\nDynegy Inc. in a transaction currently valued at $24.9 billion.\nThe buyout came after Enron's shares plunged amid an SEC\ninvestigation of the company's dealings with affiliated\npartnerships.\n\n\n\nU.S.'s Dingell Seeks Probe of Arthur Andersen, Dow Jones Says\n2001-11-19 15:24 (New York)\n\n\n     Washington, Nov. 19 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. Representative John\nDingell, a Michigan Democrat, has requested a special\ninvestigation of Arthur Andersen LLP's audits of Enron Corp. and\nWaste Management Inc., Dow Jones Newswires reported.\n\n     Dingell sent a letter to Public Oversight Board Chairman\nCharles Bowsher asking for the review, the newswire said.\n\n      Andersen, the world's fifth largest accounting firm, served\nas Enron's outside auditor for more than a decade, assuring\ninvestors the company's financial statements conformed with\ngenerally accepted accounting principles. Earlier this month, the\ncompany reported that it overstated earnings by $586 million over\nfour-and-a-half years, inflated shareholder equity by $1.2 billion\nbecause of an ``accounting error,'' and failed to consolidate\nresults of three affiliated partnerships into its balance sheet.\n\n     In June, Andersen reached a $7 million settlement with the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission in which it neither admitted\nnor denied allegations of fraud related to its audit of Waste\nManagement, Inc. Andersen is now undergoing a peer review by\nDeloitte & Touche, Dow Jones said.\n\n\nENRON RESTATES Q3 RESULTS\nFrom CBS.MarketWatch.com\n\nBy Leticia Williams\n\n8:35 PM ET Nov 19, 2001\n\nWASHINGTON (CBS.MW) - Embattled Enron Corp. restated its third-quarter\nearnings Monday,  increasing its loss for the period by 3 cents a share\nto 87 cents, according to an SEC filing.\n\nHouston-based Enron (ENE), which is being purchased by rival Dynegy to\nescape a recent spate of problems and shattered Wall Street  confidence,\nalso increased nine-month earnings by a penny to 20  cents a share.\n\nDynegy (DYN) is purchasing the company for $7.8 billion in stock.\n\nEnron must also pay off or refinance $690 million in debt obligations\nby Nov. 26 or risk triggering nearly $4 billion in additional payments,\naccording to the SEC filing.\n\nIf the company doesn't make the payment on that date, the investors\nhave the right to immediately begin to liquidate the assets of a certain\nlimited partnership for an amount equal to the note payable.\n\nIn addition, Enron may sell the limited partnership's assets for\namounts below their carrying values.\n\n\"The net proceeds from the sale of such assets can be used to repay\nEnron's obligation, \" according to the company's 10Q filed Monday with\nthe Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nEnron is in talks with lenders to \"develop a mutually acceptable\"\namendment or waiver to avoid having to issue payment on the $690 million\nnote.\n\nIf the company fails to make the payment or if its credit rating falls\nbelow investment grade, it will be forced to pay off or refinance up to\nan additional $3.9 billion, the company said.\n\nStandard &amp; Poor's currently has the company rated at BBB-, a notch\nabove speculative grade. Fitch rates the company's credit at BBB-,\nevolving. Moody's Investor services rates the company Baa3, under\nreview. All ratings apply to the senior unsecured debt of the\ncorporation.\n\nA note trigger would force the company to repay, refinance or cash\ncollaterize certain facilities in the amount of $3.9 billion, which\nprimarily consists of $2.4 billion in Osprey Trust and $915 million in\nMarlin Water Trust, Enron said in the filing.\n\nThe company's (ENE) shares gained 6 cents to close at $9.06.\n\nCompany officials didn't immediately reply to questions about where it\nwould raise the money, since it's effectively barred from the capital\nmarkets.\n\n"

Discipline above all else!\n\nNow that technological advances and the globalization of the economy have\nassured virtual teaming a place of permanence in today's business world, the\ntask at hand is to make this brand of teamwork as effective as possible.\nAuthors Jon Katzenbach and Douglas Smith emphasize discipline as the key to\nvirtual team success. This article outlines a number of helpful suggestions\nfrom their latest book, \"The Discipline of Teams,\" including establishing\nclear goals, setting measurable objectives, and agreeing upon specific work\nrules.\n\nhttp://www.kinetic-clippings.com/clippings/1001/clip1.htm\n\n2. Officing Alternatives Getting a Second Look in the Aftermath\n\n\"Necessity is the mother of invention.\" It may also be the mother of\nacceptance-prompting people who might otherwise disregard the new or the\ndifferent to give it a try when there are few other alternatives. While\nTelework and other Alternative Office concepts are not new by any means, many\nemployers and employees alike, affected by world-changing events like the\nterrible tragedies of September 11th are looking for creative strategies to\nget people back to work until they can get back to their offices.\n\nhttp://www.kinetic-clippings.com/clippings/1001/clip2.htm\n\n3. Should Employees Pay to Work from Home?\n\nFor employers who make the commitment to develop and deploy a Telework\nprogram for their employees, the costs associated with adequately equipping\nremote workers may be slightly higher than for their in-office counterparts.\nHowever, in contrast to the costs of providing office space, these expenses\nare truly insignificant. This article is an example of how Siemen's decided\nto disburse home office allowances.\n\nhttp://www.kinetic-clippings.com/clippings/1001/clip3.htm\n\n4.  Think Global\n\nIn Fortune Magazine's Sept. 3rd Edition, IDRC presented an in-depth look at\nthe value of an \"integrated workplace\"; one that supports technology,\nservices and people, in a changing economy. Check out this feature to learn\nmore, and to see results from Kinetic Workplace's State of the Industry\nsurvey.\n\nhttp://www.kinetic-clippings.com/clippings/1001/clip4.htm\n\n\n--------------\nDESIGN\n\n5. RSI: Politicians argue, \"Is there a link to computer use?\"\n\nAs politicians continue the battle over federal ergonomic regulations in the\nworkplace, scientists are waging their own fight over the cause of the\nrepetitive stress injuries (RSI), whose incidence such regulations are aimed\nat reducing. Some researchers argue that, contrary to popular belief, there\nis not a link between heavy computer use and RSI, particularly carpal tunnel\nsyndrome. Other researchers point to a large body of research documenting\nsuch a link. This article reviews evidence on both sides of the issue.\n\nhttp://www.kinetic-clippings.com/clippings/1001/clip5.htm\n\n6.  Is \"Big Brother\" such a bad thing when it comes to home safety?\n\nWhile many companies that allow telework focus on the safety and security of\ntheir networks and data, the issue of the worker's physical safety in the\nhome office is often overlooked. The lines of responsibility are not clear,\nleaving workers uncertain about what they need to do and companies fearful of\nbeing perceived as being \"Big Brother\" if they intrude too much into their\nworker's homes.\n\nJeff Zbar points out the need to ensure that your Home Office is safe and\nsecure, and provides a security check list for the home office, and a short\nquestionnaire to test your home office's security and safety. These three\narticles underscore the need for teleworkers to have a formalized policy that\nclearly outlines both their and their employer's responsibilities in\nproviding a safe and secure home office. Addressing these issues up front and\nin writing eliminates any uncertainty.\n\nhttp://www.kinetic-clippings.com/clippings/1001/clip6.htm\n\n\n--------------\nTECHNOLOGY\n\n7. Free High-Speed Wireless Net Access?\nWith the demise of Ricochet, the high-speed wireless access carrier, some\nbandwidth junkies have turned to free wireless networks. These \"freenets\" are\nset up by users via the Wi-Fi standard and cable or DSL modem sharing.

Mining company Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. reported a third-quarter profit that reversed a year-earlier loss, due to higher gold production. \nYet such good news is proving more the exception than the rule. Top chipmaker Intel said on Tuesday after the close of exchanges that profits tumbled 77 percent as it suffered from slowing global economies and weak personal computer sales. PC maker IBM announced its first quarterly earnings decline since the end of 1999 as weak sales continued to weigh on profits. \nEnergy giant Enron Corp. posted a quarterly loss after taking $1.01 billion in charges. Companies from a range of industries reported profit shortfalls, including Caterpillar Inc. , the world's largest maker of construction equipment, and Unisys Corp. , a computer company. \n\"The earnings season is one that the market has digested and in some cases predigested as being just ugly, and therefore horrible or ugly results are not met with surprise at this point,\" said Michael Holland, who runs the $65 million Holland Balanced Fund. \nFOCUS NOT ON EARNINGS \n\"The focus (for investors) has been and continues to be outside of earnings, that is, the war on terrorism specifically,\" he said. \nDynegy Inc. , a natural gas and power marketer and trader, on Monday said third-quarter earnings rose 62 percent as its backbone wholesale energy business nearly doubled its returns. While Enron posted a loss, it reported that its profit excluding charges rose 35 percent due to strong performance in its core energy business. \n\"Energy companies manage to earn pretty good money even when prices are down,\" said Jon Burnham, portfolio manager for the $170 million Burnham Fund. \"These are good, well-financed companies.\" \nCaterpillar helped to lead a litany of earnings woes. The Peoria, Illinois-based company on Tuesday said its third-quarter earnings fell 5 percent because of higher expenses and less efficient manufacturing. \nThe company also said it expects fourth-quarter revenues to be down slightly from the year-ago quarter, with full-year profit down 10 percent to 15 percent. It blamed economic uncertainty in the wake of last month's attacks for the expected shortfall, but added that 2002 sales will be at least flat to up slightly from 2001 levels. \nUnisys on Monday reported its third-quarter profits plunged by 50 percent due to weakening demand for high-end server computers and systems integration work. It said it would cut 3,000 jobs and slashed its fourth-quarter outlook. \nTAKING GRIM TIDINGS IN STRIDE \nOther companies that have reported profit drops include Novellus Systems Inc. , a maker of semiconductor production equipment, and Charles Schwab Corp. , the top U.S. discount brokerage. Schwab said Tuesday that quarterly earnings fell 51 percent as customers avoided stocks all summer, although a surge in September trading pointed to better times ahead. \nMoney managers are taking the grim profit tidings in stride. \n\"Most of these earnings situations are in these stocks,\" said Burnham. \"Barring unforeseens in the national and international situation, the market should work its way higher over the next 6 to 9 months.\" \n\"Whatever earnings are in this quarter isn't going to matter too much, except in cases where they're considerably better than expected or worse,\" he said. \nThis week is the busiest for earnings with 15 Dow Jones industrial average and 180 Standard & Poor's 500 Index companies scheduled to report. \nProfits for the companies in the index are expected to shrink by 22.8 percent, according to market research firm First Call/Thomson Financial, making it the worst quarter since the second quarter of 1991. That's down from an expected 6.2 percent decline at the beginning of the quarter, and a 14.7 percent drop expected on Sept. 10, said First Call analyst Joe Cooper. \nSome 85 S&P 500 companies so far have reported quarterly results. Of these, 50 companies have beaten the most recent, often lowered Wall Street expectations while 26 have matched and nine have missed forecasts.\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

While Enron posted a loss, it reported that its profit excluding charges rose 35 percent due to strong performance in its core energy business. \n\"Energy companies manage to earn pretty good money even when prices are down,\" said Jon Burnham, portfolio manager for the $170 million Burnham Fund. \"These are good, well-financed companies.\" \nCaterpillar helped to lead a litany of earnings woes. The Peoria, Illinois-based company on Tuesday said its third-quarter earnings fell 5 percent because of higher expenses and less efficient manufacturing. \nThe company also said it expects fourth-quarter revenues to be down slightly from the year-ago quarter, with full-year profit down 10 percent to 15 percent. It blamed economic uncertainty in the wake of last month's attacks for the expected shortfall, but added that 2002 sales will be at least flat to up slightly from 2001 levels. \nUnisys on Monday reported its third-quarter profits plunged by 50 percent due to weakening demand for high-end server computers and systems integration work. It said it would cut 3,000 jobs and slashed its fourth-quarter outlook. \nOther companies that have reported profit drops include Novellus Systems Inc., a maker of semiconductor production equipment, and Charles Schwab Corp., the top U.S. discount brokerage. Schwab said Tuesday that quarterly earnings fell 51 percent as customers avoided stocks all summer, although a surge in September trading pointed to better times ahead. \nMoney managers are taking the grim profit tidings in stride. \n\"Most of these earnings situations are in these stocks,\" said Burnham. \"Barring unforeseens in the national and international situation, the market should work its way higher over the next 6 to 9 months.\" \n\"Whatever earnings are in this quarter isn't going to matter too much, except in cases where they're considerably better than expected or worse,\" he said. \nThis week is the busiest for earnings with 15 Dow Jones industrial average and 180 Standard & Poor's 500 Index .SPX) companies scheduled to report. \nProfits for the companies in the index are expected to shrink by 22.8 percent, according to market research firm First Call/Thomson Financial, making it the worst quarter since the second quarter of 1991. That's down from an expected 6.2 percent decline at the beginning of the quarter, and a 14.7 percent drop expected on Sept. 10, said First Call analyst Joe Cooper. \nSome 85 S&P 500 companies so far have reported quarterly results. Of these, 50 companies have beaten the most recent, often lowered Wall Street expectations while 26 have matched and nine have missed forecasts.\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Bryson Hull\n\n10/16/2001\nReuters English News Service\n(C) Reuters Limited 2001.\n\nWASHINGTON, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. on Tuesday reported its first loss in more than four years after taking $1.01 billion in charges on ill-fated investments, including water and telecommunications services, which it said have clouded the strength of its core energy businesses. \nEnron, North America's biggest marketer and trader of natural gas and power, said the charges were an attempt to put its house in order after a tumultuous year in which a new chief executive suddenly resigned and the company's stock lost two-thirds of its value as once enthusiastic investors lost faith in the company.\n\"What we've tried to do here is clean up anything that we thought needed cleaning up to get these distractions out of the way,\" Chief Executive Officer Ken Lay said in a conference call. \nLay reassumed the CEO mantle at Enron after his successor, Jeff Skilling, resigned in August after only six months at the helm. \nHouston-based Enron reported a third-quarter net loss of $638 million, or 84 cents a share, compared with net income of $271 million, or 34 cents a share, in the same period of 2000. It was Enron's first loss since the second quarter of 1997. \nThe charges covered the company's loss-making broadband telecommunications business, its troubled water affiliate Azurix, and New Power Co., Enron's retail electricity joint-venture with AOL/Time Warner and IBM. \nCommerzbank Securities analyst Andre Meade said it would probably take Enron a few more quarters to rebuild confidence in the company which was a Wall Street favorite just 12 months ago. \n\"They do a couple of things very well and if they stick to their knitting, they're a solid company, but they have stumbled when they strayed further afield,\" said Meade. \nEnron's stock closed 67 cents higher at $33.84 on Tuesday, but for the year it is down about 59 percent, underperforming the Standard & Poor's utilities index .SPU), which has fallen some 23 percent over the same period. \nILL-FATED BUSINESSES \nOriginally a natural gas pipeline operator, Enron seized on opportunities created by the deregulation of U.S. energy markets to become the nation's dominant wholesale marketer and trader of natural gas and electricity. \nThe company moved into the water services business in 1998 by acquiring Britain's Wessex Water and forming Azurix, a unit which Enron took public in 1999 but had to buy back this year after it failed to meet performance targets and its stock price tumbled. \nEnron helped set up New Power Co. and take it public last year but its stock has since fallen from about $28 per share to less than $2 as companies have found it hard to make a profit in deregulated U.S. residential electricity markets. \nEnron also launched a broadband telecommunications business last year, predicting that network capacity would one day be traded like natural gas or electricity, but it has recently admitted that it overestimated the market's early potential. \nEnron's stock soared past sector peers last year when it posted a gain of 87 percent, driven by enthusiasm for the broadband plans and the success of its EnronOnline Internet energy and commodity trading platform. \nBut the stock has fallen sharply this year as broadband sentiment soured, Skilling resigned and wrangling continued over Enron's stalled Dabhol power plan project in India. \nEnron's third-quarter earnings before one-time charges rose to $393 million, or 43 cents a share, from $292 million, or 34 cents a share, meeting analysts' expectations of 42 to 45 cents a share, according to Thomson Financial/First Call. \nThe company reaffirmed its previously stated earnings targets of 45 cents a share for the fourth quarter, $1.80 for all of 2001 and $2.15 for all of 2002. \nDEBT ON CREDIT REVIEW \nRating agency Moody's Investors Service on Tuesday said it had placed all of Enron's long-term debt obligations on review for a possible downgrade. The writedowns would reduce Enron's equity base, increase its nominal financial leverage and materially impact its earnings, Moody's said. \nEnron's third-quarter earnings report showed that income at its wholesale marketing and trading division, the company's backbone moneymaker, grew 28 percent. \nThe division, which deals primarily in electricity and natural gas, saw pretax income rise to $754 million from $589 million in the third quarter of 2000. \nAll of the income growth in the segment came from Enron's gas and power trading and marketing operations in the Americas, where income grew to $701 million from $536 million last year. \nThe European segment, which includes gas and power operations there and other commodity sales like metals, coal and crude oil, remained flat at $53 million amid lower volatility. \nThe latest earnings report marked the first time that Enron has provided a financial breakdown of the European and Americas wholesale operations. \nIn doing so, Lay delivered on a promise he made after Skilling's departure: that he would make Enron's financial reporting more transparent. Many analysts and investors had grumbled about a lack of clarity from Enron.\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. \t\n\nEnron Has Third-Quarter Loss After Expansion Fails (Update9)\n2001-10-16 16:29 (New York)\n\nEnron Has Third-Quarter Loss After Expansion Fails (Update9)\n\n     (Adds in sixth paragraph that losses are equal to 70 percent\nof Enron's profits over the last four quarters. Closes shares.)\n\n     Houston, Oct. 16 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the largest\nenergy trader, had a $618 million loss in the third quarter after\nexpansion into water, telecommunications and retail-energy sales\ncost the company $1.01 billion.\n\n     The loss was 84 cents a share after payment of preferred\ndividends, Enron said. Net income a year earlier was $292 million,\nor 34 cents. Revenue rose 59 percent to $47.6 billion.\n\n     Investors have sent Enron stock down 60 percent this year on\nconcern about investments outside energy trading and natural-gas\npipelines. Some investors praised Kenneth Lay, Enron's chairman\nand chief executive officer, for acknowledging the failure of the\nnew businesses. Others said they're not confident all the bad news\nis out.\n\n     ``What is disconcerting is that they didn't do this sooner,''\nsaid Donald Coxe, manager of the $352 million Harris Insight\nEquity Fund. ``If you kill one cockroach in the kitchen, it\ndoesn't mean there aren't more.''\n\n     Investors have questioned Enron's financial reporting in the\npast year, especially after Jeffrey Skilling's resignation as CEO\nin August. Skilling, who helped Lay transform Enron from a gas-\npipeline company into the top competitor in energy trading, said\nhe left for personal reasons. Investors said they weren't\nconfident Enron was detailing all its problems.\n\n                         Failed Businesses\n\n     The $1.01 billion in losses, which total $1.11 a share, are\nequal to 70 percent of Enron's $1.45 billion in profits over the\npast four quarters.\n\n     Included were $544 million for losses on investments in New\nPower Co., a venture formed with AOL Time Warner Inc. and\nInternational Business Machines Corp. New Power competes for\nenergy sales in states that allow consumers to choose power and\ngas suppliers as they do long-distance phone companies.\n\n     The $544 million also includes losses from the Enron unit\nthat trades space, known as bandwidth, on fiber-optic networks, as\nwell as for the ``early termination of certain structured finance\narrangements'' with an undisclosed ``entity.'' Enron wouldn't be\nmore specific.\n\n     Enron said restructuring the fiber-optic unit would cost\nanother $180 million, including severance pay to 500 fired\nworkers. The business collapsed this year along with the fortunes\nof the dot-com companies that were expected to be some off its\nbiggest customers.\n\n     The declining value of assets owned by Azurix Corp., its\nwater and sewage treatment business, will cost $287 million, Enron\nsaid.\n\n     Enron might take a first-quarter ``adjustment'' of less than\n$200 million because of accounting changes related to goodwill,\nLay said in an interview. ``If we thought there were any other\nsignificant concerns, we would have taken care of them today,''\nLay said.\n\n                         Excluding Losses\n\n     Minus the losses, Enron would have earned $393 million, or 43\ncents a share, up 35 percent from the year-earlier period. That\nmatched the average estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson\nFinancial/First Call.\n\n     Enron has averaged quarterly profit increases of 31 percent\nfor the past year. Its wholesale services business, which includes\nenergy trading, had income before interest, minority interests and\ntaxes of $754 million, up 28 percent from a year earlier.\n     Shares of Enron rose 67 cents to $33.84. Earlier, the stock\nhad risen as much as 5.2 percent to $34.90.\n\n     ``There's a sigh of relief that Enron's core businesses, its\nenergy merchant businesses, are OK,'' said Roger Hamilton, who\nhelps manage John Hancock's Value funds, which own 600,000 shares.\n\n     Enron said it still expects to earn 45 cents a share in the\nfourth quarter, $1.80 for the full year and $2.15 in 2002.\n\n                     `Ridiculous Investments'\n\n     At one time, Enron pinned high hopes on the businesses that\ncontributed to the $1.01 billion in losses.\n\n     Enron spent $2.8 billion in 1998 for the U.K.'s Wessex Water,\nfrom which Azurix emerged. Enron sold shares to the public in\n1999, and then bought back the company this year after Azurix\nfailed in its strategy of buying up water companies and winning\nlarge projects. In August, Enron agreed to sell Azurix's North\nAmerican business to American Water Works Inc. for $150 million.\n\n     In February 2000, Lay said trading bandwidth could become the\ncompany's fastest-growing business. In the latest quarter, the\nbandwidth unit's loss before interest, minority interests and\ntaxes widened to $80 million from $20 million a year earlier.\n\nRevenue plunged to $4 million from $162 million.\n\n     ``You can make the case that Jeff Skilling leaving was for\nthe best,'' John Hancock's Hamilton said. ``Under him, they built\nthe best trading operation while also making all these ridiculous\ninvestments.''\n\n     While admitting its poor choices, Enron also supplied more\ninformation this quarter about how it makes money. The company\ngave results of individual commodity-trading desks, including\ncoal, forest products and steel.\n\n     ``I liked that they broke out the different commodities,''\nHamilton said. ``I think Lay has gotten the message loud and\nclear, and that the effort is there.''\n\n"

All Rights Reserved\n\nEnron, the US energy group and trader, yesterday confirmed it would cut 500 jobs, or 10 per cent of its European workforce, in an attempt to improve profits. \nKen Lay, Enron's chairman, is under pressure to restore the company's share price, which has slid more than 60 per cent in the past 12 months.\nThe cuts, flagged last week, will scale back operations Mr Lay had previously said would be critical to the company's future growth. John Sherriff, Enron Europe's president, said business continued to grow in Europe in terms of traded volumes and numbers of transactions, but the company was \"seeking ways to do more with less in order to maintain earnings growth\". \nEnron Europe has 5000 employees. Mr Sherriff said the headcount would be cut by between 5 and 10 per cent, and the company hoped to achieve this through voluntary severance. \nGordon Howald, an energy analyst at Credit Lyonnais Securities in New York, said Enron had been criticised over its strategy to increase cash flows. \n\"They are trying to slash their workforce and are selling Portland General Electric. This is good timing. When financials are under pressure, it probably makes good sense,\" he said, adding there had been rumours of US job cuts, outside of the previously announced Broadband division job cuts in July. \nEnron yesterday denied there were further job cuts planned in the US. \nLast week Enron said it had agreed to sell the electricity utility Portland General Electric to Northwest Natural Gas for $1.8bn, a disposal it had been planning for some time. \nEnron shares closed $1.81, or 5.4 per cent, higher at $35.20 in New York yesterday. \n(c) Copyright Financial Times Ltd.

In business, it's known as forced ranking. \nIn both cases, regardless of performance, someone's going to fail. The practices reward those who perform better than their peers. That's the American way.\nBut they also can punish those doing good work -- just not as good as others. In college, grading on the curve means failing a course despite learning the material and either being forced to repeat it or flunking out. In business, forced ranking means that every year some arbitrary number -- often 10 percent -- get put on notice that they must improve. Or sometimes they get fired. \nTraditionally, business has used competency-based evaluations of employees. That is, can they do the work? Forced ranking sets up a totem pole. Everyone has a place on that pole, from the top to the bottom. \nAnd the pole gets chopped off from the bottom. \nAbout 20 percent of American companies use forced ranking, according to an article on the subject in the Harvard Management Update, a newsletter from the publishing arm of the business school. \nSome companies used forced ranking only for top managers. Others use the system for all managers, or all exempt employees who are not on hourly wages. \nSome of the most admired companies use the process -- General Electric, for example. Here in Houston, Enron uses a five-point scale with 15 percent in the bottom ranking. \nProponents of forced ranking say it makes managers confront a perennial problem: that of low-performing managers and employees. \nNot only do the low performers cause problems now. If they neither improve nor leave, they block promotion for people who might do a better job. \nProductivity and morale sag. Fewer top people want to join the company. The best performers leave. \nIn what seems to be the endless American cycle of hiring and layoffs, forced ranking also gives managers some objective criteria to use when it's once again time to let people go. \nBut forced ranking also can raise the usual cries of discrimination that any ranking system brings. At Microsoft, an African-American plaintiff sued, claiming his low ranking came because of his race. At Ford Motor Co., which has dropped forced ranking, the charges of discrimination came from middle-aged white males. \nForced ranking has provided a much-needed boost at some companies -- ones that have not confronted performance problems of managers over the years. \nStill, after a few cycles of forced ranking, companies must decide what's next. So you've weeded out the slackers. You've helped those who needed help to improve their performance. Overall, the company is doing a much better job of getting the products or services out the door. \nInevitably, companies will reach a point of diminishing returns. If every manager or exempt employee is at least competent at his or her job, is it really worth it to rate and arbitrarily fire 10 percent or so of them every year? \nSure, that's going to keep everyone on their toes as they scramble to keep their jobs. But it may not be all that good in encouraging teamwork. \nAnd, as France's army found in World War I, the practice of decimation -- arbitrarily shooting 10 percent of your own troops to encourage the others to fight harder -- does not tend to raise morale. \nForced ranking also seems to me to be based on the wrong premise -- that is, that companies need to be filled with high-performance people from top to bottom to succeed. \nThat may not necessarily be true. Every organization really needs a mix of people. For example, organizations need a leavening of malcontents. They stir up things, get people thinking, challenge assumptions. Yet an organization composed of nothing but malcontents won't work. \nSure, every company needs top performers. They are the yeast that causes the organization to rise. But companies also need the steady and the sturdy and people with limited imagination to take care of the millions of details that must be faced every day. \nIt's the equivalent of taking out the trash. It's not inspiring work, but unless it gets done, it gets smelly. \nComments? Telephone 713-220-2000 and touch code 1000.

Business Line (The Hindu) Copyright (C) 2001 Kasturi & Sons Ltd. All Rights Res'd\n\nNEW DELHI, Oct. 10 IN a fresh twist to the crisis facing the $220-million LNG shipping deal for Dabhol Power Company, German-based KG Finance Group has made a proposal to the promoters of Greenfield Shipping Company to bail out the project. \n\"The promoters of Greenfield Shipping Company, however, rejected the proposal ab initio,\" sources familiar with the developments told Business Line.\nThe bailout proposal was made by the German agency during discussions held in London recently between the representatives of the three promoters (Mitsui O.S.K. Lines, SCI and Atlantic Commercial Inc) and the lending consortium led by ANZ Investment Bank. \nAs per the offer, the KG Finance Group would facilitate the completion of the 137,000-cubic-metre capacity tanker to be used for transporting LNG from Oman to Enron's power plant at Dabhol. \nThe LNG carrier would be converted into a German asset by bringing it under a special purpose vehicle (SPV) registered in Germany. The tanker would be operated by German crew. \nThe Greenfield Shipping Company is registered in the Cayman Islands and would fly a Maltese flag. The German entity had also proposed to tie up finances for the entire arrangement through a mix of public and private funding. \nKG Finance Group was of the view that the Greenfield Shipping Company had paid an \"unbelievably higher price\" for the LNG tanker by contracting it a rate of $220 million. In its reckoning, the vessel building price was at least $15 to 20 million higher than the market price prevailing then. \nAgainst this backdrop, KG Finance Group had told the representatives of the Greenfield Shipping Company assembled in London that the tanker would fetch not more than $65,000 per day as charter hire rates, the sources said. This was against the charter hire rate of $98,600 per day agreed with Dabhol Power Company. \nThe German agency had also said that it would charge a commission of 3 per cent for finalising the deal. \nThe proposal was turned down by the promoters of Greenfield Shipping Company on the grounds that transferring the asset from a Maltese flag to a German flag would deprive the tanker of depreciation benefits. \n\"Besides, the project will not break even at a charter hire rate of $65,000 per day,\" the sources said. \nThe offer made by KG Finance Group comes in the wake of a crisis facing the promoters of the LNG shipping project after the lenders suspended the last tranche of the project loan of $55 million, citing an event of default. \nThe project promoters will not be able to take possession of the LNG carrier if the remaining project cost of $55 million is not paid to the shipbuilding yard. The crisis has been compounded by the fact that Enron is planning to exit from the project by selling its 20 per cent stake in the venture. \nWhile various permutations and combinations have been discussed between the joint venture partners, nothing has taken a concrete shape so far, dragging the venture into deeper uncertainty. \nWhile making its offer, the German entity had drawn attention to the not-so-rosy LNG market globally. The LNG vessel prices are now ruling at about $165 million. \n\"Besides, about 24 LNG vessels are lying idle world- over. Even two new vessels delivered recently are lying idle without any commitment to charter,\" the sources said, pointing to the bleak scenario prevailing at the moment which has steeply driven down the charter hire rates for LNG ships. \nP.

Similarly, NCP spokesman Vasant Chavan had alleged that the decision to institute the judicial probe needed to be reconsidered. \nMr Deshmukh's outright rejection of the demand could be another reason for tension between the Congress and the NCP, sources said. \nHiking of water supply charges by the DF government is another major issue that has been hanging fire. Maharashtra Pradesh Congress committee president Govindrao Adik and other leaders had attacked the government's decision to the hike. When Mr Deshmukh was asked to state the government's response, he announced that the matter would be referred to the DF coordination committee.\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

(AEP) outlined the utility's growth objectives in a conference with financial analysts Wednesday, emphasizing its plan to lean on wholesale operations for future growth. \nAEP also noted how a planned corporate separation plan, expected to wrap up by the end of 2001 pending regulatory approval, will help by separating and clearly defining the company's unregulated operations.\n\"That is clearly going to be the major growth driver for AEP,\" said Henry Fayne, executive vice president at AEP and the newly-named head of the company's regulated operations. Fayne is also the outgoing chief financial officer at AEP. \nAEP officials said the company is targeting 8% earnings per share growth on a year-to-year basis for an undefined period. Because regulated utility operations are typically a slow-growth business, AEP expects wholesale operations to increase their contribution to earnings by at least 10% each year going forward. \nOn a shorter term basis, Fayne reiterated AEP's guidance for 2001 earnings in the $3.50 to $3.60 a diluted share range. A poll of 12 analysts by Thomson Financial/First Call, by comparison, shows the company earning $3.59 a diluted share for the year. \nAEP also maintained its 2002 earnings guidance, though it said a planned power plant acquisition announced this week should boost results by at least six cents. The company said Monday that it plans to buy two 2,000 megawatt coal-fired power plants in the U.K. from Edison International's (EIX) Edison Mission Energy unit for $960 million. \nWith that deal, 2002 earnings should fall into the $3.80 to $3.90 a diluted share range, Fayne said. A Thomson Financial/First Call poll of 13 analysts puts 2002 earnings at $3.88 a diluted share. \nTo achieve its longer term targets, AEP plans to lean heavily on its expanding wholesale trading operations. Currently, the company is the second largest wholesale electricity trader in the U.S. after Enron Corp. (ENE), and it ranks in the top ten in natural gas trading. \nThe company expects to become a top-five natural gas trader as early as the fourth quarter this year, and to continue expanding electricity trading as the market evolves. And the company's aggressive growth plans shouldn't be deterred by current weakness in natural gas prices, or by wholesale power prices that are barely above generation costs in key U.S. markets, said Eric van der Walde, executive vice president of marketing and trading at AEP. \nThe company continues to move into new markets and to use sophisticated analysis to devise market strategies, and because it isn't simply trying to sell electricity above cost, it isn't held back by sluggish markets, van der Walde said. \n\"It's not negative for us to have markets where the prices are declining,\" he said. \nFayne also noted that the performance at AEP's fleet continues to improve, which effectively adds more megawatts to its portfolio. Power plants in the company's eastern Midwest base, where it operates nearly 24,000 megawatts of power, ran at 91.8% capacity in 2001, up from 87.6% capacity a year ago. The company expects continued improvement for 2001. \nAside from the U.K. power plant acquisition plan announced this week, AEP said it remains open to other future power plant purchases. Though the company doesn't believe it needs to always own power plants in areas where it markets power, like the West Coast, owning assets in those areas can still be helpful, said E. Linn Draper, AEP's president and chief executive. \n\"We would be open to the idea of trading something here for something somewhere else,\" Draper said. \"Nothing is sacred in terms of the portfolio. Anything is fair game.\" \nThe company does plan in the near term to hold on to its large Cook nuclear plant, a 2,110-megawatt generator in Michigan that regained full operations at the beginning of 2001 after a three-year outage, Draper said. But because there has been so much consolidation in the nuclear power industry, the company is open to considering some method of outside management that might allow it to share resources with other nuclear utilities. \n-By Jon Kamp, Dow Jones Newswires; 312-750-4129; jon.kamp@dowjones.com\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The decision will create new sets of business winners and losers for  years to come. But perhaps more important, it presents a fresh opportunity for  governments, industries and individual companies to reshape the very nature of  the global marketplace. In a report prepared in collaboration with Beijing-based  People's Daily Online, Knowledge@Wharton interviewed experts for their  assessment of what lies ahead for China.http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/whatshot.cfm \nSpecial Report:\nFinding Business  Opportunities in an Uncertain Economy\nThe global economy was  declining long before September 11. Since then, it seems to have gone into a  tailspin, marked by volatile stock markets, sagging consumer confidence and  widespread layoffs. Most companies are trying to figure out how long it will  take for the economy to turn around, and what they can do to stay alive until  then. In an effort to answer these questions, Knowledge@Wharton teamed up with  CNET News.com in San Francisco to organize a panel discussion of leading  business executives from the U.S. and Europe. A special report on the  event.http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/ss_112101.html \nStrategic Management\nOh, the Games  Enron Played\nThe dramatic disintegration of Enron has left a  lot of people wondering how this huge, publicly-traded company could have fallen  so far so fast. Wharton faculty and others help explain what went on behind the  scenes at Enron, where it is now clear that management exploited loopholes in  accounting procedures and created questionable partnerships involving top  company officials, among other tactics.http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/articles.cfm?catid=7&articleid=469 \nMarketing\nMarketing  Ethics in a Post-Terrorist Economy: What is the Right  Pitch?\nFollowing the events of Sept. 11, marketers and  advertisers must reconsider not only what products they sell but how they sell  them - all against a backdrop of the War On Terror, the Anthrax scare and a  badly slumping economy. What approach can companies and ad agencies adopt that  is both ethical and effective? Wharton faculty, and the manufacturer of one  uniquely American product, offer some suggestions.http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/articles.cfm?catid=4&articleid=463 \nLeadership and Change\nFamily Matters: Are Fords, Hewletts and Packards Right to Exercise  Their Clout?\nNow that William Clay Ford Jr. has replaced  Jacques Nasser as CEO of Ford, and the Hewlett and Packard families have decided  to oppose H-P's merger with Compaq Computer, one wonders whether family members  have become wrecking balls, spoiling the well-laid plans of professional  managers and jeopardizing the company's future. Not exactly, say Wharton faculty  and others, who point to the importance of values, standards and personal net  worth.http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/articles.cfm?catid=2&articleid=468 \nManaging Technology\nThe Evolution of  B2B: Lessons From the Auto Industry\nOnly a few years ago, B2B  exchanges were expected to completely alter conventional buyer-supplier  relationships. The reality has been otherwise. Only 10% of the 1,000 B2B  exchanges launched in the past 18 months are reportedly still in operation.  Meanwhile, the important B2B action seems to have shifted to industry-wide  exchanges run by incumbent firms, such as Covisint in the auto industry and  Transora in the consumer products sector. In a new research study, Wharton  management professor John Paul MacDuffie and colleague Susan Helper explore this  evolution.http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/articles.cfm?catid=14&articleid=466 \nLeadership and Change\nReading the Signals: Janet Hanson, Founder of 85 Broads, on  Networking and Success\nJanet Hanson, 14-year veteran of  Goldman Sachs and founder of investment advisory firm Milestone Capital,  described her rocky but ultimately victorious road to success at the Wharton  Women in Business Conference held earlier this month. Later in the day a panel  of women in international management positions talked about the cultural  challenges that still confront businesswomen both here and abroad.http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/articles.cfm?catid=2&articleid=464 \nReal Estate\nReal Estate Industry  Poised for Recovery Despite Slowing Economy\nThe real estate  industry comes into the current slowdown in a much stronger position than it was  in the 1980s. But the industry is also vulnerable to a number of stresses,  ranging from scaled-down activities on the part of tenants to a significant  decline in cash flows and a softening at the high end of the retail market.  Earlier this month, members of Wharton's Samuel Zell and Robert Lurie Real  Estate Center looked at what's ahead for real estate.http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/articles.cfm?catid=8&articleid=467 \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLinks  from Knowledge@Wharton Sponsors\nGE Capital:\nJoin GE  Capital CFO Jim Parke for a December 11th webcast on \"Partnering With Our  Customers To Drive Productivity.\" Through an exchange between our CFOs and  customers, you will see and hear how we are working with our customers to solve  the heightened, day-to-day challenges of operating a business and achieving  success.

She finally got my number from\nsomeone, who told her I had already started working with Chuck.  I'm not\nsure why she called me anyway, but she basically tried to convince me what a\ngreat opportunity it would be to work with her and her \"team.\"\n\nThe only person on her \"team\" that she described was Jeff Gossett.  She said\nthat she and her husband had hired him out of Southwest Texas undergrad and\nhe had stayed with her first fund for four years (which she subsequently\nsold) until Enron recruited him away.  The stories of the recruitment seemed\na bit wild, like using private jets to fly him to Europe.  Anyway, she said\nthat he had quit Enron two weeks ago to join her in this new hedge fund.\nHaving never heard of him and thinking she seemed to be a bit of a crackpot,\nI was wondering if it was true.  I would never leave this opportunity, even\nif she offered me the world, but I have friends who really want to break\ninto hedge funds, so I was doing some due diligence on their behalf.\n\nDoes it sound like the same guy?\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: John.Arnold@enron.com [mailto:John.Arnold@enron.com]\nSent: Thursday, August 02, 2001 12:58 PM\nTo: HRobertson@cloughcapital.com\nSubject: RE: Hello!\n\n\nHey,\nSurprised to hear from you.  jeff is in charge of nat gas operations and\nreports to sally beck who is in charge of all back office ops.  as of this\nmorn, he is still here.   i've heard some wacky enron rumors before but\nthis one is pretty good.  where'd you hear this?\n\n    -----Original Message-----\n   From:   \"Robertson, Heather\" <HRobertson@cloughcapital.com>@ENRON\n\n[mailto:IMCEANOTES-+22Robertson+2C+20Heather+22+20+3CHRobertson+40cloughcapi\ntal+2Ecom+3E+40ENRON@ENRON.com]\n\n\n   Sent:   Wednesday, August 01, 2001 1:57 PM\n   To:     Arnold, John\n   Subject:  Hello!\n\n   > How are ya?!\n   >\n   > Question:  ever hear of a guy named Jeff Gossett (sp?) at Enron?\n   Supposed\n   > to be high up, but quit two weeks ago?

Officials from Dabhol Power Company, Enron's Indian arm, also attended. \nAbout 70 pct of the Dabhol plant was funded by debt, with Indian financial institutions providing 1.4 bln usd and foreign lenders the balance. \nEnron's Indian unit defaulted in September on interest payments to international lenders, blaming stopped payments by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, the plant's sole client. \ntb/pb For more information and to contact AFX: www.afxnews.com and www.afxpress.com\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

One of them is scheduled to be selected in early 2002,\" UOG said. \nUOG held separate negotiations last week with five shortlisted oil majors -- Conoco, ExxonMobil and Occidental Petroleum of the United States, BP International and the Anglo-Dutch firm Shell -- to replace the US firm Enron Corp., which withdrew from the venture in May and transferred its 24.5 percent stake to UOG. \nEnron's role was to build a 350-kilometre (220-mile) pipeline under the Gulf between Qatar and Abu Dhabi. \nThe Dolphin project aims to create a regional grid taking gas from Qatar to Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Oman and eventually Pakistan. \nIn a project estimated at an overall cost of up to 10 billion dollars, the gas is to be transported by undersea pipeline from Qatar to the Abu Dhabi coast. \nThe gas will be distributed inside Abu Dhabi and neighbouring Dubai through existing networks and will be transported between the two through a pipeline for which technical bids have already been submitted. \nThe pipeline will then continue overland to Oman and from there to Pakistan through an undersea pipeline. The extension to Pakistan is expected to cost up to an additional three billion dollars. \nlp/dab\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. \t\n\nBUSINESS & TECHNOLOGY\nNATURAL GAS BIG IN STATE'S FUTURE > NEW PIPELINES ARE PROPOSED TO FILL NEEDS\nAntonio Fins Business Writer\n\n10/14/2001\nSouth Florida Sun-Sentinel\nBroward Metro\n1H\n(Copyright 2001 by the Sun-Sentinel)\n\nProdded by rules requiring cleaner air and bolstered by a series of competing pipeline proposals, natural gas is set to become a major player in Florida's energy grid. \nThe state Public Service Commission projects that by the end of the decade, natural gas will account for 44 percent of the fuel used by Florida utilities, up from about 18 percent now. Utility companies use 85 percent of the natural gas burned in Florida.\nAs energy companies bid for the right to drill for oil and gas 100 miles off Florida's coast, other businesses are betting big dollars on natural gas. \nGulfstream Natural Gas System is already building a pipeline from Mississippi and Alabama across the Gulf of Mexico and into the Tampa area. Enron Corp. of Houston is proposing to spend as much as $400 million to build a pipeline from the Bahamas Port Everglades. \nEnron's proposal is drawing rivals. El Paso Corp., also in Houston, wants to build a Bahamas to South Florida pipeline that comes ashore in West Palm Beach. And AES Corp. has purchased Ocean Cay, a speck of an island near Bimini in the Bahamas for an energy complex that will include a power plant and a gas pipeline to Port Everglades. \nThe proposals are receiving scrutiny from county officials and environmental groups. Ultimately, federal regulators must give their approval before a pipeline can be constructed. \nStill, electric companies, which are proposing to build more than 80 new power plants in Florida through 2010, are looking to make heavy use of natural gas. \n\"Practically all the new units are going to burn natural gas,\" said Michael Haff, an engineer at the PSC. \"That's the reason for the large increase\" in projections of natural gas usage. \nAll this is quite a change for Florida's electric utilities. For decades, power suppliers have found it easier to cart coal and ship oil to burn in Florida's power plants than to pipe in natural gas. \nNor has there been much of a popular mandate for natural gas in Florida. Most users are small factories, public laundries and restaurants, where chefs prefer natural gas over electricity because it's easier to control the heat. With little need for heating homes in winter, residential use has generally been limited to barbecues, water heaters and stoves. \nConsequently, Florida uses far less natural gas than many states. Household use of natural gas is less than one-fifth of what some households in other parts of the country use. \nThe motive for the switch comes from a combination of factors. The federal Clean Air act, signed into law in 1990, is forcing utilities across the country to reduce their dependence on coal and oil and to find cleaner sources of fuel to power their generators. \nNatural gas is one of those options. \nAlvaro Linero, the administrator who reviews power plants for the state Department of Environmental Protection, said natural gas emits no particulate matter, the tiny particles that can lodge in lungs and aggravate respiratory conditions. Unlike oil or coal, it gives off no sulfur dioxide, which causes acid rain. It is also easier to control nitrogen oxide emissions, a key component of smog, when natural gas is the fuel rather than oil or coal. \nFlorida Power & Light Co., the largest of the electric companies, has already heavily invested in natural gas generators -- 21 of its 29 non-nuclear power plants are able to run on natural gas. \nFPL said it turns to natural gas occasionally to save customers money, but the utility, regulators and industry groups could not say how much money is saved by the switch. \nAnother factor behind the projected rise in usage of natural gas is its growing availability. By 2005, natural gas supplies are expected to surge after one pipeline, which will run gas across the Gulf of Mexico, is finished. Local government and industry officials also expect the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will give the green light to one of the Bahamas-to-Florida pipeline projects as well. \nStill, some environmental groups say that, while they want cleaner energy, they worry that the push to natural gas raises other fears. \nOne concern voiced by civic activists is that the gas pipeline project will create safety hazards at local ports and parks. Enron, which applied to build a Bahamas-to-Florida pipeline, said it has taken steps to make sure it is safe. But Broward officials and a conservationist group, Hollywood-based Save Our Shores, have expressed reservations in filings before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which must approve the pipeline project before construction begins. \nThe safety of natural gas pipelines has received more attention recently. After a pipeline exploded in Carlsbad, N.M., last year, killing 12 people, the federal government moved to tighten regulations and require annual testing. \nAnd the massive increase in natural gas use by the electric companies dismays some natural gas advocates. \nThey insist the best way to employ it is by piping it directly into homes for water heaters, stoves and even gas-run air conditioning units -- a more efficient and cost-effective use of natural gas than running electric generators, they argue. \nBut state regulators and industry officials say that it is too costly to hook up homes in established neighborhoods because of the expenses in construction and re-landscaping, so expecting large numbers of people to convert from electric to gas appliances is unrealistic. \nDisagreements aside, the consensus is that the state's power utilities and consumers will soon have another fuel and energy option. \n\"We don't expect [natural gas usage] to decline. If anything, we may see an increase,\" said Lance Horton, marketing director for People's Gas Co. \"At the end of the day, the customer is going to have another choice that was not there before.\" \nStaff Writer David Fleshler contributed to this report. \nAntonio Fins can be reached at afins@sun-sentinel.com 954-356- 4669.\n\nPHOTO MAPS 2; Caption: Staff file photo/Carl Seibert Pipeline view: Enron proposes a natural gas pipeline from the Bahamas that would have a terminal in the foreground, just south of I-595, after passing under Port Everglades in the background.

Yesterday, the company said it will cut more. \nIt's been crushed by huge debt and battered by a sharp drop in demand for its mainstay instant film amid a shift to digital technologies and a weak economy. \n\"How such a place, with so much success and so much technology, could lose that much money and get into so much debt, I don't understand,\" said Lloyd Taylor, a retired Polaroid chemist who has also consulted for the company. \"A lot of people I've known, both retirees and some that are still there, are just totally demoralized.\" \nPolaroid, founded by visionary Edwin H. Land in 1937, said it will remain open for business and continue to make and ship its core instant-film products, even as it \"accelerates and intensifies\" its search for a buyer under bankruptcy court protection. \nBut it will slash operations, with an unspecified number of job cuts expected. Anything that's not part of its core business - products that rely on instant film - is subject to sale or elimination. \nThat includes the company's sunglass division, its photo- identification business, and others. Polaroid, already selling off real estate and other assets, will seek to sell more and will shutter plants. \nSpokesman Skip Colcord would not provide specifics regarding closings or job cut plans. \"I think everything's on the table,\" he said. \nPolaroid confirmed it terminated its retiree health and life insurance plans as well as severance payments to former U.S. employees. \nA federal bankruptcy judge authorized $13.1 million until Monday for employee wages and checks outstanding, said Polaroid lawyer Gregg Galardi. It will seek approval to continue employee health care benefit payments as well, and to honor service warranties on products. \nIn its filing, Polaroid listed $1.81 billion in assets and $948.4 million in debt. Top creditors include Enron Energy Services, Tad Resources International and Dupont Teijin Films US, all with multi- million dollar claims. \nAs expected, Polaroid said it had obtained a commitment for $50 million in so-called debtor-in-possession financing from a bank group led by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. Polaroid will seek court approval to use $40 million of that loan Monday to meet obligations, including paying suppliers on or after yesterday's filing. Lawyers also said Polaroid had a $33 million offer for its identification business. \nCrushed by the weight of its debt, including about $600 million owed to bondholders and $335 in bank loans, Polaroid had teetered on the edge of bankruptcy for months, and received a series of waivers on terms of its lending agreements, while it sought a buyer for some or all of its assets. \nIts once-mighty instant-film business was turned into a cash generator to fund development of new digital-imaging technologies. Earlier this year, Polaroid unveiled new digital printing technology, code-named Opal and Onyx, designed to let consumers and businesses instantly develop prints taken with digital cameras. \nSome say Polaroid lost a step with the departure of Land, its founder and visionary, who stepped down as chief executive in 1980 and as chairman in 1982. Land died in 1991. \nA Harvard University dropout and son of a scrap-metal dealer, Land began to research light polarization in the 1920s, focusing on sunglasses, desk lamps and reducing car headlight glare, before turning to instant film. \nAs legend has it, Land took a picture of his young daughter on a vacation in Santa Fe, N.M., and she asked why she couldn't see the picture right away. Land set to work on the problem immediately, and before long was applying for patents. \nBy 1988, Polaroid was trying to fight off a hostile takeover bid. Financier Stanley Gold's Shamrock Holdings had offered $3 billion for Polaroid, or about $45 a share. Company management eventually rebuffed Shamrock, but spent millions in legal fees and racked up a massive debt to block the takeover bid, from which it has yet to recover. \nGraphic: Historic developments (photo/text graphic) \n** 1937 -- Edwin H.

All Rights Reserved\n\nEnron wins court injunction \nEnron, which is poised to pull out of the largest foreign direct investment in India, has won an injunction from a court in London preventing the regional government of Maharashtra from challenging arbitration proceedings launched by the US power company.\nEnron's opponents say the court decision, which is confined to appeals in India, significantly reduces legal defences for Maharashtra, where the 2,184MW power plant is located, and is likely to raise the stakes in the Houston-based company's increasingly messy attempt to withdraw from India with full compensation. \nOfficials at Enron's Indian arm, Dabhol Power, say the legal move was designed to prevent Maharashtra from trying to stall arbitration through endless legal obstacles.

Trader co=\nnfidence took a beating after a flurry of weak economic data and earnings, =\nbut there is hope that economic stimulus and low interest rates will turn t=\nhings around.  The news from the economic front has been a defining force t=\noday, as durable goods orders fell a surprising 8.5%, significantly steeper=\n than the 1.3% forecast by analysts.  The Labor Department's Unemployment C=\nost Index rose 1% in the third quarter, coming in above the 0.9% forecast, =\nand sales of existing homes came in below analyst expectations as well.  So=\nme analysts see recession in numbers like those, but recession or no, there=\n's clearly downward pressure on the market.  Nonetheless, traders are looki=\nng for positive things in the future, and seem to see buying opportunities =\ntoday.  - - - - - MORE Breaking News  [IMAGE] [IMAGE]    [IMAGE]=09[IMAGE]=\n=09\n\n\n =09    [IMAGE]  Today's Feature - Thursday      Risk Remains So Get Divers=\nified So you think the worst is over?

Trade shorts are quickly losing confidence based upon cash, shape of curve, and momentum.  I think curve flattens a little more and then comes down in parallel shift down.\n1.  jan and feb are highest storage adjusted prices on curve.  For market area sales, add on basis and dec and march are next.  Question is whether there is enough non-discretionary stg to meet load at other times and in the producing region.  A lot of stg has to come out either for tariff or engineering reasons.  Million dollar question.  \n2.  Think Nov bidweek will be weak.  Don't know who baseload buyers are unless trade gets bullish.  Nov is a relatively flat month as far as injections.  stg operators dont have room to buy baseload gas and I think utilities will be planning to meet load using stg.  At current prices, producers apply more pressure to wells, lng doesnt get diverted again, lose some load to resid, lose any momentum of industrial load coming back.  Dont think gas market can handle that.  \n3.

Still very reserved on the finish, but those who are patient should be rewarded.  Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc.  Best after 2005\"Have your own tasting notes?

An immense wine that reminds me of a barrel sample; patience required. Best from 2004 through 2010. \"Have your own tasting notes?

Its dense purple color is followed by a sexy, open-knit nose offering explosive aromas of pain grille, blackberry, and cherry liqueur intermixed with currants.

If you enjoy great White Burgundies then this is your Italian counterpart ! This wine is also straw colored with crisp apple and lemon aromas. Medium bodied with fresh acidity, finishes with hints of vanilla.A blend of Grechetto & Chardonnay this is the white version to the Rosso that just scored 96 points Robert Parker.Have your own tasting notes?

Deep, highly concentrated aroma of black fruits, bitter chocolate, shoe polish and humus. Thick but bright on entry, then quite full and consistent through to the very long whiplash of a finish. Really stuffed with fruit, and beautifully balanced. Dense flavors of cassis, violet, bitter chocolate and Cuban tobacco. Substantial ripe tannins are thoroughly buffered by the wine fat. A great showing today. Jaboulet used helicopters to dry the fruit after the showers, then picked quickly.\" Have your own tasting notes?

Emshwiller\nStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal\n\n10/19/2001\nThe Wall Street Journal\nC1\n(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)\n\nA limited partnership organized by Enron Corp.'s chief financial officer, A=\nndrew S. Fastow, realized millions of dollars in profits in transactions it=\n did with Enron, according to an internal partnership document.=20\nThe partnership, in some instances, benefited from renegotiating the terms =\nof existing deals with the Houston energy company in ways that improved the=\n partnership's financial positions or reduced its risk of losses.\nMr. Fastow, and possibly a handful of partnership associates, realized more=\n than $7 million last year in management fees and about $4 million in capit=\nal increases on an investment of nearly $3 million in the partnership, whic=\nh was set up in December 1999 principally to do business with Enron.=20\nThe profits from the deals were disclosed in a financial report to investor=\ns in the partnership, LJM2 Co-Investment LP, that was signed by Mr. Fastow =\nas the general partner and dated April 30. In one case, the report indicate=\ns the partnership was able to improve profits by terminating a transaction =\nearly.=20\nThe LJM2 arrangement has become controversial for Enron, as shareholders an=\nd analysts have raised questions about whether it posed a conflict by putti=\nng the company's chief financial officer, who has a fiduciary duty to Enron=\n shareholders, in a position of reaping financial rewards for representing =\nLJM2 investors in business deals with Enron. Investors in LJM2 include Wach=\novia Corp., General Electric Co.'s General Electric Capital Corp. and Credi=\nt Suisse Group's Credit Suisse First Boston.=20\nAttention has focused on Mr. Fastow's partnership activities at a tumultuou=\ns time for Enron, which over the past decade grew enormously by becoming th=\ne nation's biggest energy-trading company.=20\nThis year, though, it has been hit by a string of troubles, from soured bus=\niness initiatives to executive departures. On Tuesday, Enron announced a $6=\n18 million third-quarter loss, because of a $1.01 billion write-off on inve=\nstments in broadband telecommunications, retail energy services and Azurix =\nCorp., a water company. A small chunk of that write-off, about $35 million,=\n was attributed to ending certain LJM2-related transactions. That terminati=\non also produced a $1.2 billion reduction in Enron shareholder equity as th=\ne company decided to repurchase 55 million shares that had been part of LJM=\n2 deals.=20\nAt 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron was down 9.9%=\n, or $3.20, to $29 a share. Within the past year, the stock had topped $80 =\na share.=20\nEnron officials didn't have any comment about the LJM2 partnership document=\n. Enron has consistently said its dealings with LJM2 have been proper. They=\n said the LJM2 deals, like ones done with other parties, were aimed at help=\ning hedge against fluctuating market values of its assets and adding source=\ns of capital.=20\nMr. Fastow has declined several requests for an interview about LJM2. In la=\nte July, he formally severed his ties with LJM2, as a result of what Enron =\nofficials said was growing unease by Wall Street analysts and major shareho=\nlders. Mr. Fastow has been finance chief of Enron since 1997 and has been w=\nith the firm 11 years, which included extensive work setting up and managin=\ng company investments.=20\nMichael Kopper, a former Enron executive who an Enron spokesman said is now=\n helping to operate LJM2, declined to comment. He also wouldn't describe hi=\ns relation to LJM2.=20\nIn his April 30 report, Mr. Fastow said the partnership, which raised $394 =\nmillion, had invested in several Enron-related deals involving power plants=\n and other assets as well as company stock. The document said LJM2 sought a=\n 29% internal rate of return. That was down from a 48% targeted rate of ret=\nurn at the end of 2000, which the document said was due in part to a declin=\ne in the value of LJM2's investment in New Power Co., an Enron-related ener=\ngy retailer. In some transactions, LJM2 did much better than the 29% target=\n, though this sometimes involved renegotiating individual deals.=20\nIn September 2000, the partnership invested $30 million in \"Raptor III,\" wh=\nich involved writing put options committing LJM2 to buy Enron stock at a se=\nt price for six months. Four months into this deal, LJM2 approached Enron t=\no settle the investment early, \"causing LJM2 to receive its $30 million cap=\nital invested plus $10.5 million in profit,\" the report said. The renegotia=\ntion was before a decline in Enron's stock price, which could have forced L=\nJM2 to buy Enron shares at a loss of as much as $8 each, the document indic=\nated.\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Swanson <mailto:kcswanson@thestreet.com>\nStaff Reporter\nTheStreet.com\n10/19/2001 06:59 AM EDT\nURL: <http://www.thestreet.com/markets/dumbest/10002661.html>\n\n1. Bayer Fighting the Bears?\nOne beneficiary of the anthrax scare has been Bayer AG (BAYZY:OTC BB ADR - =\nnews - commentary) , the German chemical maker, which has seen its share pr=\nice gain 10.4% since the terrorist attacks. But investors bidding up the st=\nock might be getting ahead of themselves.=20\nBayer makes Cipro, a leading treatment for anthrax. But while the demand fo=\nr Cipro is high, sales from the drug are only a small portion of the compan=\ny's overall revenue, which totaled 30.9 billion euros last year (and, accor=\nding to analysts, will increase even more this year, due to its acquisition=\n of Aventis CropScience, a crop protection and production company). To put =\nthe demand for Cipro in context, J.P. Morgan expects U.S. sales of the drug=\n to be approximately 1.2 billion euros for 2001.=20\nEven emergency purchases of Cipro probably won't add that much to Bayer's o=\nverall revenues. The president has asked for $643 million for antibiotics t=\no combat bioterrorist attacks. While it's possible that sum will be increas=\ned, not all the money would be spent on Cipro.=20\nBesides, it's not even clear that Bayer will remain the only producer of Ci=\npro. Though the company holds the patent for the drug, there's some pressur=\ne in Congress for the government to purchase a generic version from other m=\nanufacturers.=20\nOn another front, Bayer is currently battling a class-action lawsuit relate=\nd to an anti-cholesterol drug implicated in a number of deaths. It was forc=\ned to withdraw the drug from the market.=20\nBayer may offer protection against anthrax, but that doesn't mean it's a re=\nfuge for investors.=20\n2. Losses at Twice the Price\nYou know things are bad for a company when its losses per share are double =\nthe price of the shares themselves. That's the case for i2 Technologies (IT=\nWO:Nasdaq - news - commentary) , the supply-chain software maker. After mar=\nket close on Tuesday, the company posted losses under generally accepted ac=\ncounting principles that amounted to $5.5 billion, or $13.25 per share, for=\n the latest quarter, including all charges.=20\nIn other words, i2's losses were more than twice the value of its share pri=\nce, which closed at $5.69 before the announcement.=20\nMuch of the huge writedown reflects amortized goodwill from the purchase of=\n Aspect Development in March 2000.=20\nTo be fair, investors in companies that have made big acquisitions like i2 =\ntypically focus on pro forma earnings, which exclude charges and extraordin=\nary items. By that measure, i2's losses didn't look quite so bad: The compa=\nny met analysts' consensus expectations with a loss of $55.3 million, or 13=\n cents per share.=20\nStill, investors met i2's earnings with disapproval, knocking the stock dow=\nn 25% the day after they were reported.=20\n3. Microsoft's Bag of Tricks\nIn times like these, there's comfort in knowing business goes on as usual a=\nt many U.S. companies. Just like the old days, Microsoft (MSFT:Nasdaq - new=\ns - commentary) is in the hot seat for its sharklike behavior toward a comp=\netitor.=20\nIt stands accused of sending 3,000 fake cereal boxes emblazoned with the wo=\nrds \"Microsoft Server Crunch\" to customers of rival server software maker N=\novell. The boxes, according to Novell, contained \"a number of false and mis=\nleading statements\" intended as putdowns of Novell products.=20\nAmong the attempted insults were some not-so-clever plays on packaged food.=\n For example, in a reference to Novell's flagship software product, a line =\non the Microsoft boxes read: \"What's the expiration date on that NetWare pl=\natform?\" (A round of applause, please, for those gut-splittingly funny engi=\nneers.)=20\nThe boxes also said Novell is shifting its focus from software to consultin=\ng services, which Novell says isn't true.=20\nMicrosoft spokesman Jim Desler said the cereal boxes were primarily intende=\nd to advertise Microsoft services, not to slight Novell. \"It was all in the=\n theme of a mock cereal box,\" he said. \"It was a modest campaign.\"=20\nIn response to Novell's complaints, he says Microsoft sent out a letter in =\nSeptember to recipients of the boxes to clarify some of its statements, and=\n it's just agreed to send another letter to appease the company. For the re=\ncord, Novell said it's not calling off its lawsuit for unspecified money da=\nmages.=20\n4. AMD's Feisty Pledge\nCEOs don't get their jobs by being eloquent, and it probably would be too m=\nuch to expect them to sound statesmanlike. But sometimes their oratorical r=\nough edges cross the line into embarrassing.=20\nCase in point: Comments from Jerry Sanders, the CEO of Advanced Micro Devic=\nes (AMD:NYSE - news - commentary) , which earlier this week reported a loss=\n for the first time in almost three years. The company, facing harsh pricin=\ng competition from Intel (INTC:Nasdaq - news - commentary) , said its reven=\nue was down 22% from a year ago and it expects a likely operating loss for =\nthe fourth quarter.=20\nGiven recent declines in consumer confidence, the downturn is likely to be =\nextended by several quarters, Sanders admitted. But in a conference call, h=\ne indulged in some spirited fist-shaking. Citing the company's so-called \"H=\nammer\" architecture for processors, Sanders declared, \"We feel that when th=\ne upturn comes, we're going to kick ---.\"=20\nDoes this guy carry around a surfboard in his car or what? Mr. Sanders, mee=\nt Mr. Reeves.=20\nOK, so we actually kind of admire Sanders' never-capitulate spirit. But his=\n comment seems a little redundant, because just about everybody will look b=\netter when the economy turns around. Because that may not be anytime soon, =\nwhat matters is how companies weather the interim -- feisty pledges notwith=\nstanding.=20\n5. Enron's Rabbit-From-a-Hat Style\nAnalysts have complained for some time about Enron's (ENE:NYSE - news - com=\nmentary) rabbit-from-a-hat style accounting, with which the company produce=\nd results that wowed investors without making it quite clear where they cam=\ne from. Now that its business has taken a sour turn, that tendency has gott=\nen even more unsettling.=20\nTo cap off its disappointing earnings results this week -- Enron posted a s=\nteep loss after taking a $1.01 billion charge -- the company let drop that =\nits shareholder equity had decreased by $1.2 billion.=20\nIn a conference call, CEO Kenneth Lay attributed the reduction in equity to=\n the \"removal of an obligation to issue a number of shares.\" According to a=\n report in The Wall Street Journal, Enron repurchased 55 million shares iss=\nued through a series of transactions involving LJM Capital, a partnership t=\nhat until recently was headed up by Enron's CFO.=20\nTSC's Peter Eavis has written that it appears Enron lent LJM money to buy E=\nnron stock.=20\nIronically, the company boasted in its earnings release this week that it h=\nad expanded reporting of its financial results, presumably to quiet its acc=\nounting critics.=20\nEnron's transactions have been so labyrinthine that it's hard to identify e=\nxactly if or how they were inappropriate. But the latest revelation, to say=\n the least, does nothing to bolster the company's credibility. Enron, whose=\n CEO resigned unexpectedly in August, had seen its stock fall 59% for the y=\near leading up to its latest earnings release. Since then, it's dropped ano=\nther 12.6%=20\n\n\nThe New Power Company Revises Its Netting Agreement With Enron; Provides Fo=\nr Receivables and Inventory Financing\n\n10/19/2001\nBusiness Wire\n(Copyright (c) 2001, Business Wire)\n\nPURCHASE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 19, 2001--The New Power Company (\"New=\nPower\"), a wholly owned subsidiary of NewPower Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: NPW) t=\noday filed a Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission reporting=\n that it has revised its master netting agreement with Enron North America =\nCorp., Enron Energy Services, Inc., and Enron Power Marketing, Inc. (togeth=\ner, the \"Enron Subsidiaries\").=20\nThe amendment affects the Master Cross-Product Netting, Setoff, and Securit=\ny Agreement (the \"Master Netting Agreement\") among NewPower and the Enron S=\nubsidiaries, and expands through January 4, 2002, the types of collateral t=\nhat NewPower is permitted to post to the Enron Subsidiaries.\nThe effect of the amendment is to reduce, through January 4, 2002, the amou=\nnt of cash collateral that NewPower is required to post to the Enron Subsid=\niaries. Under the amended Master Netting Agreement, the first $70 million o=\nf posted collateral must be in the form of cash, while amounts in excess of=\n $70 million may consist of not more than $40 million of eligible receivabl=\nes and inventory of NewPower, valued at discounts specified in the amendmen=\nt, and subject to a $25 million limit for October 2001. Pledging receivable=\ns and inventory is consistent with NewPower's previously announced intentio=\nn to secure asset-backed financing.=20\nWith the amendment and NewPower's cost reduction efforts, and absent a simi=\nlar rate of decline in commodity prices or other significant events, NewPow=\ner believes that it has sufficient financial resources to conduct its busin=\ness until it secures ongoing asset-backed financing, which will be necessar=\ny upon the expiration of the amendment. NewPower has been and is actively s=\neeking to arrange asset-backed financing with other parties, although to da=\nte no such arrangements have been secured.=20\nThe Company expects to meet its previous estimate of net loss and loss per =\nbasic and diluted share for the third quarter ended September 30, 2001. How=\never, customer count and revenues are expected to be slightly lower than pr=\neviously forecast.=20\nThe Company will provide revised guidance for the fourth quarter 2001 and a=\nn outlook for 2002 on its third quarter conference call scheduled for Thurs=\nday, November 8.=20\n\nCautionary Statement=20\n\nThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements within the m=\neaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A=\n of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange =\nAct of 1934.

All rights reserved.\n\nHow do the Washington lobbying firms with the heftiest incomes put themselv=\nes in the upper echelon of K Street practitioners? Van Scoyoc Associates In=\nc. does it by signing up a stable of smaller clients and working hard to re=\ntain them. Quinn Gillespie & Associates doesn't have a long client list, bu=\nt it is at the top of the heap in terms of average fee per client. Greenber=\ng Traurig, meanwhile, lured away a rival firm's top rainmaker-and his lucra=\ntive book of clients.=20\nThese are just some of the business strategies revealed in National Journal=\n's survey of the 10 Washington lobbying firms with the highest fee income f=\nrom January 1 to June 30. The four top firms at midyear 2001 are the same o=\nnes as a year earlier: perennial powerhouses Cassidy & Associates Inc.; Pat=\nton Boggs; Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld; and Verner, Liipfert, Bernhar=\nd, McPherson and Hand.\nBut two new players-boasting huge growth rates-are among the firms nipping =\nat the heels of these top dogs.=20\nGreenberg Traurig, which came in at No. 5 in National Journal's midyear 200=\n1 rankings, had never before been in the top tier of Washington lobbying fi=\nrms. According to PoliticalMoneyLine, which compiles a comprehensive annual=\n list of all lobbying firms, Greenberg Traurig had the 35th-highest income =\nduring the first six months of last year.=20\nAnd No. 7 in the midyear 2001 rankings is Quinn Gillespie, another first-ti=\nme member of the top 10. Formed just a year and a half ago by former Clinto=\nn White House Counsel Jack Quinn and Ed Gillespie-a one-time adviser to Hou=\nse Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas-the firm has seen its fortunes rocke=\nt upward. Quinn Gillespie was No. 13 in the first six months of 2000.=20\nIn between these two newcomers is Van Scoyoc Associates, ranked at No. 6. T=\nhere has been a steady rise for Van Scoyoc, which was No. 28 in fee income =\nat the end of 1996, the year in which the 1995 Lobbying Disclosure Act firs=\nt took effect.=20\nRounding out the top 10 at midyear 2001 are stalwarts Williams & Jensen; Wa=\nshington Council Ernst & Young; and Barbour Griffith & Rogers.=20\nNational Journal ranks the top-10 lobbying firms every six months by tallyi=\nng the fees that firms report to the House and Senate as required under the=\n 1995 legislation. National Journal tabulates total fees for only the 25 to=\np firms in PoliticalMoneyLine's comprehensive annual survey.=20\nWith its $16.68 million in fees for the first six months of the year, Cassi=\ndy & Associates continued to blow away the competition. The last time any f=\nirm reported a six-month total larger than Cassidy's was during the first h=\nalf of 1998, when Verner, Liipfert led the way. During the first six months=\n of this year, Cassidy & Associates received a massive fee of $1 million fr=\nom the Taiwan Studies Institute, a think tank with close ties to the Taiwan=\nese government; Boeing Co. paid Cassidy & Associates $600,000; and Tiffany =\n& Co. paid it $400,000 to lobby on legislation that would bar diamonds mine=\nd in conflict-ridden areas of the world from entering the global market.=20\nDespite the economic downturn and the terrorist threat, lobbying goes on, c=\nompany Chairman Gerald S.J. Cassidy said. \"During difficult times, people c=\nome to Washington with their problems. During more-robust times, they come =\nseeking opportunities.\"=20\nBut the biggest story at midyear was the rise of Greenberg Traurig. The fir=\nm, which posted just $1.71 million in lobbying fees during the first half o=\nf 2000, saw that amount more than quadruple to nearly $8.7 million this yea=\nr. Much of the credit goes to Jack Abramoff, the conservative K Street move=\nr and shaker who is an ally of House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas. Last=\n year, Abramoff left his old firm, Preston Gates Ellis & Rouvelas Meeds, an=\nd brought $3 million in business with him to Greenberg Traurig. Preston Gat=\nes, which was ranked in the top five during Abramoff's tenure, dropped out =\nof National Journal's rankings this year. The lobbying firm's fees fell by =\nnearly 50 percent.=20\nAbramoff continued to make rain at Greenberg Traurig, billing $860,000 to t=\nhe Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians, $500,000 to the Commonwealth of the=\n Northern Mariana Islands, and $300,000 to garment manufacturers that opera=\nte in that U.S. territory. A few new clients also forked over big bucks: th=\ne Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana ($440,000); Voor Huisen Project Management, =\na homebuilder with international operations ($300,000); and the American In=\nternational Center ($100,000). Despite initial concerns among some Greenber=\ng Traurig partners about whether Abramoff would fit in, Abramoff insists th=\nat his team of lobbyists has been \"totally integrated\" into the firm.=20\nBut Abramoff wasn't the only one responsible for Greenberg Traurig's higher=\n earnings. Ronald W. Kleinman, a former State Department lawyer, persuaded =\nCongress with the help of several Greenberg Traurig colleagues to pass Sect=\nion 2002 of the 2000 Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act. Th=\nis section of the law ordered the Treasury Secretary to use Cuban governmen=\nt funds that are frozen in U.S. banks to compensate the families of three m=\nen who had won multimillion-dollar judgments against Cuba under a 1996 amen=\ndment to the Foreign Sovereignty Immunities Act. The amendment allows victi=\nms of terrorism or their families to sue states that are on the U.S. list o=\nf state sponsors of terrorism.=20\nGreenberg Traurig represented the families of Armando Alejandre, Carlos Alb=\nerto Costa, and Mario M. de la Pena-three members of Brothers to the Rescue=\n, a Cuban-American group that rescues Cubans in the waters off Florida. The=\n three men died when their plane was shot down over international waters on=\n February 24, 1996. The families sued Cuba and were awarded $96.7 million i=\nn damages by a U.S. District Court judge in 1997. The State Department oppo=\nsed payment, but President Clinton signed the trafficking bill. Greenberg T=\nraurig reported a fee of $4 million.=20\nFred W. Baggett, the chair of Greenberg Traurig's governmental practice gro=\nup, said this was a one-time fee, but he added that the Cuban case \"establi=\nshed a platform so that the firm can support undertaking those one-time eff=\norts in the future,\" and noted, \"We have a few coming down the pipeline.\"=\n=20\nBaggett said the firm has cases involving an American killed in Jerusalem b=\ny the Palestinian group Hamas, and Americans who were used as human shields=\n in Iraq during the Persian Gulf War. None of the Americans was killed, and=\n all were eventually released.=20\nTaking the flip side of the mega-fee approach was Van Scoyoc Associates, wh=\nich reported receiving no fee above $180,000. Nonetheless, the firm continu=\ned its steady rise. A key reason, said firm President H. Stewart Van Scoyoc=\n, was the ability to recruit and retain clients. The firm signed up 34 clie=\nnts between January 1 and June 30, while only nine out of 159 clients termi=\nnated contracts during the period.=20\n\"We work hard at defining the relationship with a client before we sign a c=\nontract,\" said Van Scoyoc. \"We make sure we're clear on the goals and objec=\ntives, and in a typical relationship, we don't guarantee that we can do eve=\nrything.\" The firm's $6.24 million total for the first half of 2001 was 23 =\npercent higher than its fees for the same period last year.=20\nQuinn Gillespie's ascent into the top 10 was more along the lines of Greenb=\nerg Traurig's. Quinn Gillespie's billings were almost $6.09 million at midy=\near 2001, a 71 percent rise over the same period last year. The firm has on=\nly 34 paying clients, but the average fee per client-$180,000-is the highes=\nt among the top 10. During the six months, the British Columbia Lumber Trad=\ne Council paid a fee of $540,000 to Quinn Gillespie, while Enron Corp. paid=\n $525,000. The Canadian group hoped its high-powered lobbyists would win gr=\neater access for Canadian lumber in the United States, but U.S. tariffs wer=\ne reinstated earlier this year. Lobbying for Enron focused on energy deregu=\nlation, particularly in California. Enron is a major creditor of Southern C=\nalifornia Edison, the utility whose financial woes resulted in power shorta=\nges in California last summer.=20\nQuinn Gillespie's staff has grown from nine at the time of the founding to =\nnearly 30 today. \"We like to think we have a toolbox here-people who may be=\n Republicans or Democrats but who also have different skills that benefit t=\nhe client,\" Quinn said.=20\nPatton Boggs had fees of $10.26 million in the first six months of 2001, bu=\nt that was just a 5 percent rise over the same period in 2000. Still, the f=\nirm leapfrogged over Verner, Liipfert to capture the No. 2 ranking. Patton =\nBoggs earned $360,000 from Russia's government-owned NTV television network=\n, which was at the center of a controversy earlier this year when the gover=\nnment took over the independent network and ousted its staff.=20\nAkin, Gump also jumped past Verner, Liipfert to No. 3 in the rankings, post=\ning $9.48 million in fees-a 16 percent increase over a year earlier. Akin, =\nGump's biggest client was the troubled tire manufacturer Bridgestone/Firest=\none Inc., which paid just over $1.5 million in fees. Akin, Gump also earned=\n big money from AT&T ($800,000) and the Gila River Indian Community ($620,0=\n00).=20\nAt No. 4, Verner, Liipfert saw the biggest drop in fees, taking in $8.84 mi=\nllion in the first six months of 2001-down 16 percent from the same period =\nin 2000. Verner, Liipfert lost lucrative contracts with Puerto Rico after t=\nhe government there changed hands last year. (See this issue, p. 3273.)=20\nRounding out the top-10 rankings, Williams & Jensen at No. 8 billed $5.68 m=\nillion, a 12 percent increase over the first half of 2000, while Washington=\n Council Ernst & Young saw its fees drop 11 percent to $5.5 million. The fi=\nrm fell four places to No. 9 in the rankings. Barbour Griffith & Rogers's f=\nee income was up 7 percent to $5.48 million, putting the firm at No. 10.=20\nFalling out of the midyear top-10 rankings were Preston Gates-No. 6 at midy=\near 2000-and PricewaterhouseCoopers, No. 7 last year. PricewaterhouseCooper=\ns's billings were $5 million for the period, a 6 percent drop from the firs=\nt half of 2000.\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Brown Convention Center put the spotlight on Wei=\nngarten Realty Investors Chairman Stanford Alexander; Compaq Computer found=\ner and former Chief Executive Officer Rod Canion; retired Reliant Energy Ch=\nairman and CEO Don Jordan; and Dynegy Chairman and CEO Chuck Watson.=20\nThis is the 19th year the nonprofit Texas Business Hall of Fame Foundation =\nhas honored the state's business leaders with a dinner and induction event.=\n=20\nAs chairman of Weingarten Realty Investors, Stanford Alexander built the co=\nmpany into one of the nation's largest publicly traded real estate companie=\ns.=20\nAfter serving in the U.S. Air Force, Alexander joined J. Weingarten, a Hous=\nton-based chain of 87 supermarkets. He later became an executive with Weing=\narten Markets Realty Co., an affiliated real estate firm that developed fre=\ne-standing supermarket stores.=20\nThe firm later changed its name to Weingarten Realty. The Houston-based com=\npany is now publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange.=20\nWeingarten owns shopping centers, warehouses and other property in 17 state=\ns from coast to coast.=20\nWeingarten's notable developments in Houston include the upscale Village Ar=\ncade near Rice University and the Centre at Post Oak, across from the Galle=\nria.=20\nRod Canion came up with the idea behind Compaq in 1982 after a trip to a lo=\ncal ComputerLand store. Along with colleagues from Texas Instruments, Jim H=\narris and industrial designer Ted Papajohn, Canion envisioned a portable co=\nmputer that ran all the programs that operated on the IBM PC.=20\nBy the next year, the company was producing the original Compaq luggable co=\nmputer, a move that essentially created the modern PC industry. By 1987, it=\ns fifth year, the company made business history by breaking $1 billion in s=\nales, the fastest pace ever for a corporate startup.=20\nCanion left Compaq in October 1991 but continued to be active in other vent=\nures. In 1992, he founded Insource Technology Group, a consulting services =\nand network engineering firm, and continues to serve as chairman.=20\nDon Jordan has been in the forefront of Houston business and society for de=\ncades. And even though he retired from the post of chairman and chief execu=\ntive at Reliant Energy in late 1999, he has remained active in the city's g=\nrowth and development.=20\nJordan was with Reliant and its predecessor Houston Industries for 44 years=\n and helped position the company for its eventual split between the company=\n's regulated businesses, such as HL&P and Entex, and unregulated business t=\nhat is now called Reliant Resources.=20\nJordan, along with his corporate rival Ken Lay of Enron, was instrumental i=\nn the successful campaign last year to convince voters to approve the use o=\nf public funds to build a new arena downtown for the Houston Rockets.=20\nJordan has spent a lot of time on the Houston Livestock Show & Rodeo board =\nand many other civic groups.=20\nChuck Watson has built Dynegy into one of Houston's leading energy companie=\ns, but he is more well-known for his forays into the world of sports.=20\nWatson established NGC Corp., Dynegy's predecessor, in 1985 and served as p=\nresident until becoming chairman and chief executive officer in 1989.=20\nRecently Watson was revealed to be the largest investor in the limited part=\nnership assembled to put together the Texans, Houston's National Football L=\neague franchise. It begins playing next year.=20\nWatson also owns the Aeros, Houston's American Hockey League team.=20\nWatson's support was also pivotal to getting voters last year to approve th=\ne use of public funds for the new downtown arena. Watson had opposed an ear=\nlier deal to use public money to build the facility.=20\nWatson has also been a strong supporter of Houston's bid to land the 2012 O=\nlympic Games.=20\nTo date, the foundation has awarded more than $1.8 million in scholarships =\nto students pursuing business degree at Texas colleges and universities.=20\n\nRecession, Budget Cuts, Travel Fears To Subdue LME Week\nBy Mark Long\nOf DOW JONES NEWSWIRES\n\n10/19/2001\nDow Jones Commodities Service\n(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)\n\nLONDON -(Dow Jones)- The many travails of the metals industry will dampen t=\nhe spirits of those who make it to the annual round of meetings and parties=\n at London Metal Exchange Week, which starts Monday.=20\nIn what is expected to be a much smaller group of delegates than usual, con=\nversations will be dominated by fears of global recession smothering alread=\ny-lousy demand, the increasingly pressing need for production cuts, and the=\n exit of several important participants from the metals business.\nCuts in companies' travel budgets and fears of flying are keeping many of t=\nhe usual attendees away from London this year, dealers and analysts said.=\n=20\n\"Sentiment is going to be bearish, and we've just heard in the past few day=\ns of people who were previously going to come along not coming, largely on =\ntheir companies' advice,\" said Adam Rowley, an analyst at MacQuarie Bank in=\n London.=20\nIndeed, a representative at another major bank said fully half of the guest=\ns expected at its satellite activities have canceled.=20\nForecasts for base metals demand and average prices have been widely revise=\nd downward in the past few weeks, particularly since the impact of the Sept=\n. 11 terror attacks accelerated the world economic slowdown.=20\nJust this week, Standard Bank ratcheted its expectations lower, with LME ca=\nsh copper - a bellwether for the complex that's especially sensitive to ind=\nustrial productivity - seen at $1,350 a metric ton in December 2001, down f=\nrom an actual year-to-date average in 2001 of $1,619/ton.=20\nProducers are reluctant to cut copper output, and declining Chinese imports=\n and weak demand in the west mean there is still further downside potential=\n for copper, Standard Bank analyst Robin Bhar said.=20\nWith demand for base metals slumping so sharply, eyes have been turning to =\nthe producers to make moves on the supply side.=20\nIn copper, analysts say U.S. producers are the most likely to cut back, as =\nthe recent strength in the dollar hits their bottom line the hardest. Howev=\ner, a recent slump in energy prices has kept the wolves from the door so fa=\nr for some producers in an industry that's energy-intensive.=20\nElsewhere, zinc is suffering from a supply glut that recently pressured the=\n LME three-month price to a 17-year low of $766 a metric ton.=20\nThe troubles of Australian zinc producer Pasminco Ltd. (A.PAS) will surely =\nbe a hot topic, following the company's move to voluntary administration du=\ne to its large debt load, dealers said.=20\nBut aside from all the market concerns, the most worrisome topic will likel=\ny be the recent succession of companies bailing out of or reducing their co=\nmmitment to the metals business, market participants said.=20\nIn the past week, N.M. Rothschild & Sons Ltd. quit the base metals business=\n and ScotiaMocatta - the metals trading arm of the Bank of Nova Scotia (T.B=\nNS) - removed itself from open-outcry ring trade at the LME. Earlier this m=\nonth, Enron Metals said it would cut staff by 10%-20% in Europe, and all th=\nese moves follow Mitsui Bussan Commodities Ltd. ditching its market-making =\nactivities in the metals business earlier this year.=20\nWho's next?=20\n\"It could be anyone,\" is the refrain from nearly all market participants su=\nrveyed.=20\n-By Mark Long, Dow Jones Newswires; +44 (0)20 7842 9356; mark.long@dowjones=\n.com\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The court permitted MERC m=\nembers P. Subrahmanyam and Venkat Chary to be impleaded as respondents. The=\ny have been asked to file affidavits by November 9.\nThe multinational power giant had levelled certain allegations of bias agai=\nnst an MERC member Jayant Deo. Mr Deo urged the court that he would like to=\n recluse himself from the proceedings.=20\nDPC was allowed to amend its main petition in view of the allegations level=\nled against Mr Deo and were asked to amend it within week.=20\nIn his affidavit replying to allegations of bias by the DPC, Mr Deo said he=\n was neutral in his stand as a MERC member.=20\nThe court has made it clear that when the hearing in the case commences, tw=\no intervening parties, US Exim Bank and a consortium of 11 offshore lenders=\n of DPC would not be allowed to make any pleadings. The court, however, sai=\nd they would be permitted to assist the court by making oral submissions.\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. =09\n"

Moreover, Enron's new CFO, who has been portrayed by bulls as opposing the related-party dealings of his predecessor, serves on 12 of these entities. And Enron board members are listed as having directorships and other roles at a Houston-based related entity called ES Power 3. \nThe extent of Enron's dealings with these companies, or the value of its holdings in them, couldn't be immediately determined. But the existence of these partnerships could feed investors' fears that Enron has billions of dollars of liabilities that don't show up on its balance sheet. If that's so, the company's financial strength and growth prospects could be much less than has generally been assumed on Wall Street, where the company was long treated with kid gloves. \nEnron didn't immediately respond to questions seeking details about ES Power or about the role of the chief financial officer, Jeff McMahon, in the various entities. Enron's board members couldn't immediately be reached for comment. \nTen Long Days\nEnron's previous CFO, Andrew Fastow, was replaced by McMahon Wednesday after investors criticized Fastow's role in a partnership called LJM, which had done complex hedging transactions with Enron. As details of this deal and two others emerged, Enron stock cratered. \nThe turmoil that resulted in Fastow's departure began two weeks ago, when Enron reported third-quarter earnings that met estimates. However, the company failed to disclose in its earnings press release a $1.2 billion charge to equity related to unwinding the LJM transactions. Since then, investors and analysts have been calling with increasing vehemence for the company to divulge full details of its business dealings with other related entities. Enron stock sank 6% Friday, meaning it has lost 56% of its value in just two weeks.\nEnron's End Run?   \nNew financial chief's involvement in Enron business partners\nEnron-Related Entity\tCreation DateMcMahon Involved?\t\t\n\t\t\t\nECT Strategic Value Corp.4/18/1985\tYes\t\t\nJILP-LP Inc.\t9/27/1995\tYes\t\nECT Investments Inc.\t3/1/1996\tYes\t\nKenobe Inc.\t11/8/1996\tYes\t\nEnserco LLC\t1/7/1997\tYes\t\nObi-1 Holdings LLC\t1/7/1997\tYes\t\nOilfield Business Investments1/7/1997\tYes\t\t\nHGK Enterprises LP Inc.\t7/29/1997\tYes\t\nECT Eocene Enterprises III Inc.2/20/1998Yes\t\t\t\nJedi Capital II LLC\t9/4/1998\tYes\t\nE.C.T.

The company has said nothing publicly about McMahon's participation in related entities, nor has it mentioned that its board members were directors or senior officers in ES Power 3. (Nor has it explained the extensive use of Star Wars-related names by the related-party companies.) It's not immediately clear what ES Power 3 is or does. So far, subpoenas issued by lawyers suing Enron have determined the names of senior officers of ES Power 3 and its formation date, January 1999. \nAmong ES Power 3's senior executives are Enron CEO Ken Lay, listed as a director, and McMahon and Fastow, listed as executive vice presidents. A raft of external directors are named as ES Power 3 directors, including Comdisco CEO Norman Blake and Ronnie Chan, chairman of the Hong Kong-based Hang Lung Group. A Comdisco spokeswoman says Blake isn't commenting on matters concerning Enron and a call to the Hang Lung group wasn't immediately returned. \nDemands, Demands\nRating agencies Moody's, Fitch and S&P recently put Enron's credit rating on review for a possible downgrade after an LJM deal that led to the $1.2 billion hit to equity. Enron still has a rating three notches above investment grade. But its bonds trade with a yield generally seen on subinvestment grade, or junk, bonds, suggesting the market believes downgrades are likely. \nIf Enron's rating drops below investment grade, it must find cash or issue stock to pay off at least $3.4 billion in off-balance sheet obligations. In addition, many of its swap agreements contain provisions that demand immediate cash settlement if its rating goes below investment grade. \nFriday, the company drew down $3 billion from credit lines to pay off commercial paper obligations. Raising cash in the CP market could be tough when investors are jittery about Enron's condition. \nThis week, a number of energy market players reduced exposure to Enron. However, in a Friday press release, CEO Lay said that Enron was the \"market-maker of choice in wholesale gas and power markets.\" He added: \"It is evident that our customers view Enron as the major liquidity source of the global energy markets.\" \nMcMahon reportedly objected to Fastow's role in LJM, allegedly believing it posed Fastow with a conflict of interests. But he will need to convince investors that the 12 entities he's connected to don't do the same. Enron has said that its board fully approved of the LJM deals that Fastow was involved in. Now, board members will have to comment on their own roles in a related entity. \n\nUnder The Radar: Enron's Flickering Bulb\nBy Christopher Edmonds <mailto:cedmonds@thestreet.com>\nSpecial to TheStreet.com\n10/26/2001 05:08 PM EDT\nURL: <http://www.thestreet.com/comment/chrisedmonds/10003075.html>\n\nWhile the bulb at Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) may not have burnt out, it's clearly flickering. To date, investors aren't sure whether Chairman and CEO Ken Lay is up to the task of re-energizing the company he once built to greatness. \nWhat's happened at the Houston energy giant-turned-dwarf could've been imagined with any number of ne'er-do-well companies during the well-chronicled bubble. But this is Enron. As one longtime Enron bull and shareholder said, \"I never had to worry about Enron's ability to survive until this week. I still find it hard to believe.\" \nPeter Eavis has done an exceptional job of chronicling Enron's adventures for some time. If you'd listened to him earlier this year, you'd have profited from his knowledge. His reporting on Enron's partnership shenanigans to the departure of Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow has been outstanding. \nThe rumors -- from a pending bankruptcy to a Justice Department investigation -- are, for now, just that. And, Enron did not single-handedly cause the California power crisis, nor is Royal Dutch/Shell (RD:NYSE - news - commentary) about to make a bid to buy the company. Sources do tell me that head-count reductions are likely through employee buyout offers and the company is set to refocus on its core energy business. And, while former CEO Jeff Skilling shares culpability for the current mess, his departure appears only indirectly related to Enron's current woes. \nNow, Enron faces the daunting challenge of rebuilding both its business and, more importantly, its reputation. \nThe Company's Challenge\nBut what does Enron do now? It's very simple. Come clean, clean up the mess and refocus on its core business: wholesale energy markets, risk management and retail energy services. They support each other and create a platform that can be plenty profitable without a lot of gimmicks. \n\"Our gut feel is that Enron can pull it off, and long-term investors should hold firm, as eventually the stock gets valued on earnings, with upside potential to $25 per share over the next 12-18 months,\" says Jeff Dietert, power analyst at Simmons & Co. and a member of the TSC Energy Roundtable. \"We believe new money with high risk tolerance should wait until Enron announces its intentions for communicating a clear path to recovery.\" \nDietert outlines four challenges for Enron. One, management must regain the Street's confidence and persuade investors that it can resolve balance-sheet strength and generate the expected earnings and cash flow. Two, Enron must maintain its investment-grade credit rating. Three, Enron must successfully execute its divestiture plans. Four, Enron must control the timing of the recognition of the write-down in the value of any assets where market value is less than book. \nStraightforward? Yes. Easy to accomplish? No. \nAlthough Enron says additional write-downs are unlikely -- except a $200 million charge early next year as the result of an accounting change -- analysts aren't so sure. They're focused on the company's Global Assets portfolio, sporting $6 billion in book value but generating an EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) loss of $18 million over the past 12 months. \nThe divestitures include $390 million in exploration and production assets in India, $250 million in a Puerto Rico power plant and $250 million in a Brazilian power plant in the fourth quarter as well as the pending sale of Portland General, which is set to close in 2002. There will likely be others. However, Enron has to execute here, and given the current state of its affairs, the seller will feel the pressure. \nThe credit-rating issue is a fine line. The current ratings, BBB+ from Standard & Poor's and Baa1 from Moody's, are three levels above non-investment grade. However, both rating agencies now have Enron on their radar screens for possible downgrades. Dietert estimates that Enron's debt-to-market cap will be about 48% by year-end, and the company has interest coverage (EBITDA/ interest expense) of about 3.5 times. By comparison, the average S&P BBB-rated company has a debt-to-cap of 47.4% and interest coverage of about 6.1 times. The average BB company has debt-to-cap of 61.3% and interest expense of 3.8 times. \nFrankly, everything falls on Enron's management team and its ability to reassure investors. \"If Enron's management does not step up to calm investor fears, these fears could become a self-fulfilling prophecy,\" Dietert says. \"In the potentially vicious cycle, investor fears could drive stocks down; the lower stock prices force the rating agencies to consider downgrades; potentially lower credit ratings force counter-parties to reduce exposure to Enron, limiting Enron's ability to generate earnings and cash flow.\" \nIt's time for Enron to grow up. Despite a lot of uncertainties and risk, I think it will. Investors with risk capital should do their homework on the stock and think about strategy. It's a tough call that requires strict, individual discipline. \nThere's an irony to this whole story, especially in Enron's lack of candor in reporting its financial results. In a much-lauded advertising campaign, Enron, looking to challenge conventional wisdom, asks the simple question, \"Why? Ask why.\" \nInvestors are now asking. It's time for Ken Lay to answer. \nFirst Things First\nMany readers have asked about my relative quietness this week. Thank you for your concern. My father has fallen ill after fighting the effects of a brain tumor for more than a decade. \nThe choice was easy. I'm with him and my family. \nEnjoy your weekend with family and friends. \n\n\n\nDJ Enron Unit,New England Market Downplay Report Of Default\n2001-10-26 17:14 (New York)\n\n   By Kristen McNamara \n   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \n \n  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Enron Corp.'s (ENE) retail sales unit defaulted on its\ncredit requirement in New England's wholesale power market this month, but the\nevent was neither unique nor newsworthy, the energy company and the\norganization that developed the market's rules said Friday. \n\n  The operator of the region's wholesale power market informed Enron Energy\nServices last week that, for the third time in 12 months, it had traded a\ngreater volume of electricity than allowed by the bond it had posted and was at\nrisk for expulsion from New England's market. \n\n  But it was administrative mixups, rather than financial problems, that\ntriggered the warning, which a few other companies have also received in the\npast, the market's rulemaker said. \n\n  \"I can state with considerable confidence that there have been other\nparticipants\" that have defaulted on their credit agreements, \"and it's never\nbeen in the news,\" said David Doot, secretary and general counsel for the New\nEngland Power Pool, which developed the policies governing the region's\nelectricity market. \"My instinct is that this is blown way the hell out of\nproportion.\" \n\n  News of the Enron unit's default appeared in a trade publication and a major\nmetropolitan newspaper this week, as Enron's dealings with partnerships headed\nby its former chief financial officer contributed to a plunge in the company's\nstock and bond prices. \n\n  Enron Energy Services never received word that it had defaulted on its\nbonding requirement twice before, because both times it corrected the problem\nwithin a day, spokeswoman Peggy Mahoney said. \n\n  The letter sent by ISO New England, which operates the region's power market,\nto notify the Enron unit of its third violation was addressed to the wrong\nperson, delaying the company's response, Mahoney said. \n\n  \"Clearly, it was an administrative error that we immediately took care of to\nensure that we would never exceed the volume limit,\" Mahoney said. \n\n  The company resolved the problem by Oct. 19, Mahoney said. ISO New England\nspokeswoman Ellen Foley confirmed Friday that the company had cured its\ndefault. \n\n  It's rare for a company to default three times, but it has happened on\noccasion, Foley and Doot said. \n\n  \"I won't say it's commonplace, but I won't say it's unusual for a participant\nto find itself out of compliance,\" Doot said. \"Those things have in fact\nhappened from time to time.\" \n\n  -By Kristen McNamara, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-2061;\n\n\n\nEnron Lawsuit Over Microsoft Broadband Agreement May Block MSN\n2001-10-26 16:47 (New York)\n\nEnron Lawsuit Over Microsoft Broadband Agreement May Block MSN\n\n     Houston, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s lawsuit\nalleging Microsoft breached a contract for broadband services\ncould temporarily block the largest software company's high-speed\nInternet service in some U.S. regions.\n\n     Microsoft said the dispute temporarily blocks the company\nfrom providing the high-speed service in areas where Enron\nprovides broadband access, leaving MSN fully operational only in\nthe 14 states where Qwest Communications International Inc.\noperates, said Bob Visse, director of marketing for MSN.\n\n     Enron's lawsuit was filed yesterday.

Requests also were sent to 17 Enron partnerships such\nas Whitewing Management and Marlin Water.\n\n     Paradis represents Fred Greenberg, an Enron shareholder who\nis suing the company's board for allowing former Chief Financial\nOfficer Andrew Fastow to run partnerships that cost the company at\nleast $35 million in cash and $1.2 billion in lost shareholder\nequity.\n\n     The requests are aimed at determining if Enron executives\nbenefited financially from roles as officers and directors of\npartnerships that bought and sold company assets. Enron formed at\nleast 18 such affiliated companies, listing executives and\nemployees as officers and directors of the partnerships, according\nto Texas secretary of state records.\n\n     Under Texas law, failure to respond to the document requests\nwill result in subpoenas being issued.

Enron, the biggest energy trader, and other power sellers\nhave denied the charges repeatedly.\n\n     Next month, a California Senate committee investigating the\npower market plans to hold a hearing to determine if Enron and\nother generators are complying with subpoenas for trading\ndocuments. Enron has been filing documents in Sacramento,\nCalifornia.\n\n     ``They are still putting documents in their depository, and I\ndon't think they've completed that process,'' said Alexandra\nMontgomery, a consultant to the committee. It ``remains to be\nseen'' whether Enron is complying with its subpoena, she said.\n\n     The suits and inquiries came after wholesale power prices in\nCalifornia soared, leaving the state's two largest utilities\ninsolvent. Under California's plan to open its electricity market\nto competition, the utilities of PG&E Corp. and Edison\nInternational weren't allowed to pass rising costs to customers.\n\n     ``I know that we're doing our best to comply with what the\ncommittee is asking for,'' Enron spokesman Mark Palmer. ``We are\nputting documents in the depository, and we're looking forward to\na speedy resolution.''\n\n     Shares of Houston-based Enron have fallen by more than half\nsince Oct. 16. The company ousted Andrew Fastow as the chief\nfinancial officer Wednesday amid a U.S. Securities and Exchange\nCommission inquiry into a partnership he ran that cost Enron $35\nmillion.\n\n                            Grand Jury\n\n     Enron also is one of the companies being investigated for\ncivil and criminal violations by California Attorney General Bill\nLockyer, who convened a grand jury in June.\n\n     Lockyer has been criticized by Enron officials for telling\nthe Wall Street Journal in May that he would like to put Enron\nChairman Kenneth Lay in ``an 8 x 10 cell that he could share with\na tattooed dude who says `Hi my name is Spike, honey.' '' Lockyer\nlater apologized for the remark.\n\n     The attorney general's investigation is proceeding, Lockyer\nspokeswoman Sandra Michioku said. Michioku said she didn't know\nwhen civil or criminal charges against Enron or other power\nproviders might be filed.\n\n     ``Our investigation is still being pursued,'' she said. ``We\nhad to go to court to get Enron to turn over documents, so that\nslowed things down a bit.''\n\n     Enron's Palmer said he didn't know the status of the attorney\ngeneral's investigation.\n\n     ``I think the attorney general demonstrated his willingness\nto take a fair and impartial look a long time ago when he made his\nvulgar and unfounded remarks about our chairman,'' Palmer said.\n\n                           More Lawsuits\n\n     Enron, along with other major power providers such as Duke\nEnergy Corp. and Dynegy Inc., face at least five lawsuits alleging\nthey manipulated California energy prices in violation of\nantitrust laws.\n\n     The cases, which include separate complaints filed by the\nCity of San Francisco, California Lieutenant Governor Cruz\nBustamante and various consumers, currently are in state courts\nawaiting a coordination proceeding, said Michael Aguirre, a lawyer\nrepresenting Bustamante.

The shares fell 95 cents,\nor 5.8 percent, to $15.40 today.\n\n     Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay has failed to reassure\ninvestors that the company's credit rating won't be cut, investors\nsaid. Enron can no longer borrow in commercial paper markets,\nwhere short-term loans carry lower rates than banks offer.\n\n     ``Do they have the financial flexibility they once had? No,''\nsaid John Cassady, who helps manage $3 billion in bonds at Fifth\nThird Bancorp. ``People are questioning the credibility of\nmanagement.''\n\n      The company will use its credit line to pay off $2.2 billion\nin commercial paper it has outstanding, Enron spokesman Mark\nPalmer said.\n\n                            Bonds Drop\n\n     Enron's 6 3/4 percent bonds, which mature in 2009, declined 1\n1/2 points to a bid of 84 cents on the dollar and an offer of 86\ncents. At that price, the bonds, which carry a rating of ``BBB+,''\nyield 9.53 percent.\n\n     Investors have grown concerned that the company's credit\nrating will be cut after $1.01 billion in third-quarter losses\nfrom failed investments. Enron needs good credit to raise cash\ndaily to keep trading partners from demanding collateral and to\nsettle transactions.\n\n     Enron's decision to tap its credit line was ``a smart\nfinancial move,'' said Stephen Moore, a vice president at Moody's\nInvestors Service who follows the company. ``It took away the\nhassle and time-consuming nature of rolling commercial paper and\ninsured access to capital.''\n\n     Though Enron's bonds have investment-grade ratings, their\nyield at current prices is higher than those of industrial bonds\nthat carry junk ratings. According to Bloomberg data, companies\nwith ``BB'' ratings pay on average 9.16 percent to borrow for\nseven years.\n\n     A lower credit rating may also force Enron to buy back\nholdings in other partnerships with its stock, diluting the value\nof Enron investors' stock.\n\n     Partnerships called Whitewing, Marlin and Yosemite own Enron\nassets they bought with borrowed money. Enron sold the assets to\nthe partnerships to keep related debt off its books. The\npartnerships plan to repay the borrowed money by selling the\nassets.\n\n                         Other Liabilities\n\n     If Enron loses investment-grade rating, the borrowed money\ncomes due earlier, leaving less time for the partnerships to find\nthe best price for the power plants and other assets. Enron would\nhave to make up any shortfall between what the assets would sell\nfor and the amount of the debt.\n\n     One way would be issuing common shares to exchange for Enron\npreferred convertible shares held by the partnerships. That would\nthin out the holdings of every other investor.\n\n     Of the two main bond-rating companies, Moody's and Fitch have\nEnron on watch for possible downgrade, and Standard & Poor's\nlowered Enron's long-term credit outlook to negative. Egan-Jones\nRating Co. today lowered its rating on Enron's debt to ``BB+,''\none notch below investment grade, from ``BBB-.''\n\n     Enron's liabilities associated with the partnerships amount\nto at least $3.3 billion, the company has said.\n\n     Enron ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow on\nWednesday amid a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into a\npartnership he ran that cost the company $35 million in direct\nlosses. Enron also bought back 62 million shares from the\npartnership, reducing shareholder equity by $1.2 billion.\n\n     ``It looks like the guy who was supposed to do everything for\nthe benefit of shareholders was running partnerships for the\nbenefit of himself,'' Fifth Third's Cassady said.\n\n     Jeff McMahon, head of Enron's industrial markets group, was\nnamed CFO in a bid to restore investor confidence, Lay said in a\nstatement.\n\n--Russell Hubbard in the Princeton newsroom at 609-750-4651, or at\n\n\nKeller Rohrback L.L.P. Investigates Potential Claims on Behalf of Enron Corp. -- ENE -- Employees and Former Employees\n\n10/26/2001\nBusiness Wire\n(Copyright (c) 2001, Business Wire)\n\nSEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 26, 2001--Seattle's Keller Rohrback L.L.P. is currently investigating potential ERISA claims on behalf of participants and beneficiaries of Enron's retirement and 401(k) plans. \nThe investigation period covers January 2000 through October 2001. The investigation focuses on concerns that, under the law interpreting ERISA, Enron and its plan administrators may have breached their fiduciary duties of loyalty and prudence by failing to disclose and inform the Plan participants and beneficiaries with respect to the use of employer stock as a Plan investment. Rather than providing complete and accurate information to the Plans' participants, it may be alleged that Enron and the plan administrators may have withheld and concealed material information, thereby encouraging participants and beneficiaries to continue to make and to maintain substantial investments in company stock and the Plans. This investigation is being conducted in light of recent events.\nOn Oct. 16, 2001, Enron surprised the market when it announced that the Company was taking \"non-recurring charges totaling $1.01 billion after-tax, or ($1.11) loss per diluted share,\" in the third quarter of 2001. Enron later revealed that a material portion of the charge related to the unwinding of investments with certain limited partnerships, controlled by Enron's CFO, and that the Company would be eliminating more than $1 billion in shareholder equity as a result of its unwinding of the investments. As this news began to be assimilated by the market, the price of Enron common stock dropped significantly. In addition, several recently filed securities suits allege that Enron executives engaged in extensive insider trading, gaining millions of dollars in personal proceeds. Enron retirees have lost a substantial portion of their retirement earnings due to the drop in value of their retirement assets. \nIf you are a member of an Enron retirement plan, wish to discuss this announcement, or have information relevant to the investigation, you may contact paralegal Liza Catabay, or any member of our team (Britt Tinglum, Liza Catabay, or Lynn Sarko) toll free at 800/776-6044, or via e-mail at investor@kellerrohrback.com. \nSeattle's Keller Rohrback L.L.P. has successfully represented shareholders and consumers in class action cases for over a decade. Its trial lawyers have obtained judgments and settlements on behalf of clients in excess of seven billion dollars.\n\n\nCONTACT: Keller Rohrback L.L.P.

                "Content": " JARNOLD (Non-Privileged).pst\n\n\n\n\nA backup seat and a backup computer have been assigned to you.  Please read this communication in detail.\n\n\nPurpose:  Net Works has developed a backup plan for possible work stoppages after moving to the new building.  A wider business continuity plan will be rolled out next year.\n\nLocation:  Large areas of the 30th and 31st floors of the current building, Enron Center North, will be set aside for recovery purposes.  Your name has been put on the list and you will be notified once the seat assignments are finalized.  Locations will also be posted at the entryways on the 30th and 31st floors.\n\nTiming.  Through November, backup seats assignments will be announced as each trading group moves to the new building.  The backup seats will be available at least to January 1st.\n\nTesting.  Test times to try the backup PC and to familiarize yourself with your backup location will be announced by the IT team as the locations are finished.\n\nTelephones.   Only regular phones will be available.  For those with speed dial phones, the IT team will download the numbers and leave them on a piece of paper at your seat assignment.  Because the numbers change frequently, we ask that you rely on keeping track of the numbers yourself and use the number lists as a last resort.\n \nOther supplies.  The IT team is not responsible for non-technical or special needs.  If you rely on hard copy forms, address books, etc, you will need to be sure to leave appropriate supplies when you test the computer, or bring supplies along if you are asked to move to your backup seat.\n\nLimited Access.  The backup floor is not meant as a backup day-to-day work environment.  To keep the equipment functioning and secure, we plan to limit access except for test times and if we need to invoke the plan because of a work stoppage.  \n\nEscalation Procedures.  The plan will be  as follows:  \n\nI.\tDuring regular business hours\n\nA.  Announcement.  You will be notified via the PA system if you need to move to the backup location.  \n\n-OR-\n\nB.  No Announcement.  If an obvious problem like a fire or power shutdown occurs, for example, all personnel with a seat assignment will be expected to make their way to their backup seat without notification.\n\n\nII.\tAfter hours\n\nFor after hours issues, greeters will announce the move to the backup location as people arrive to work.  E-mails and voice mails will also be distributed.\n\n"

Progressing into the Northeast by wednesday, Philly and New York will get into the below normal category, but 5 or 6 degree anomalies are most likely.  Looks like a three day event as it moves easterly and then is followed by moderation into the...\n\n6-10 Day time period, which will see a cool shot over the Midwest/East towards next weekend, moderating again by early the following week. Then, early in the...\n\n11-15 Day time period, more cool air moves in, beginning with central cooling, then even into the Southeast.\n\nSo, with normals dropping across the nation, this first cool air anomaly event arriving in the Midwest by Tuesday will elevate the nation's gas demand requirements into the 60 Bcf/d plus regime from here on through the winter.

Consensus estimates were for 33 cents a share. Sante Fe International is also due to report today. \nSalomon Smith Barney expects North American spending on drilling to fall by 20 per cent in 2002, with spending outside North America to rise by 10 per cent to 15 per cent. \nMark Urness, an SSB analyst, said earnings estimates for most drillers remained too high for the fourth quarter and needed to be cut. \"We are expecting them to provide lower guidance for 2002 as third quarter earnings are reported,\" he said. \nOn the exploration and production front, Bill Featherstone, a UBS analyst, said fourth-quarter results for companies including Devon and Apache would also be hit by weak oil and gas prices. \"Obviously fourth- quarter results will trend down for the sector given reduced oil and natural gas prices,\" he said. \nCompanies will need to show financial discipline and outline policies of keeping their spending in line with operating cash flow. Analysts are likely to look closely at capital expenditure budgets. \nEnergy trader Dynegy also reports today, followed by rivals Enron and Duke Energy tomorrow. \nCopyright: The Financial Times Limited\n\n\n\nCOMPANIES & FINANCE INTERNATIONAL: Tata in talks to buy Enron power plant \nFinancial Times; Oct 15, 2001\nBy SHEILA MCNULTY and KHOZEM MERCHANT\n\nTata, the Indian conglom-erate, has held exploratory talks to buy a controversial power plant from Enron, the US energy giant. \nTata Power, part of the Bombay-based industrial group, has written to the Indian government expressing interest in the plant, which is India's biggest foreign investment. However, it said any deal would have to address the high tariff structure and interest rate burden on the project. \nKenneth Lay, Enron's chief executive and chairman, told the Financial Times in August that Enron and its partners wanted to retrieve the Dollars 1bn incurred building the now-defunct Dabhol plant. \nIt is understood that Enron is considering an offer price of about 80 cents to the dollar. \nEnron declined on Friday to confirm it was in talks with Tata, but said the best solution would be for the Indian government, or one of its Indian financial backers, to take on Dabhol. \nTata Power recently held talks with Indian financial institutions involved with the project. Officials from Dabhol Power Company, Enron's Indian arm, also attended. \nAbout 70 per cent of the Dabhol plant was funded by debt, with Indian financial institutions providing Dollars 1.4bn and foreign lenders the balance. Enron's Indian unit defaulted in September on interest payments to international lenders, blaming stopped payments by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB), the plant's sole client. \nAnalysts favour a quick sale. \"Tata would be a faster exit and resolve it once and for all,\" said Ronald Barone of UBS Warburg. \"It is better to take a small loss and move along. Dabhol periodically becomes a problem and an issue, and it depresses the stock.\" \nAnalysts said the fit between Tata and its putative target would be complementary, though it would probably stretch the company's balance sheet. \nThe Tata group is already committed to a heavy capital expenditure of some Rs30bn (Dollars 625m) on power-related projects over the next three years. \nA further Rs9bn is slated for telecommunications and broadband projects. \nCopyright: The Financial Times Limited\n\n\nBase Metals Traders Struggle In Tough Trading Conditions\nBy Wong Chia Peck\nOf DOW JONES NEWSWIRES\n\n10/15/2001\nDow Jones International News\n(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)\n\nSYDNEY -(Dow Jones)- The spate of decisions by big-name participants to scale down or quit base metals trading last week didn't surprise participants in Asia, given the market's tough trading conditions, they said. \nIn fact, should the current dismal conditions prevail for the next six months, more such announcements are likely, they added.\nTheir comments follow the recent decisions by prominent members of the London Metal Exchange to either downsize their base metals trading divisions or quit entirely. \n\"Clearly, they, like us, are victims of reduced volumes,\" said a senior LME trader in Sydney, adding that all market participants are suffering from the declining throughputs and trade volumes. \nFigures from the LME's Web site show that the trading volumes for aluminum, copper, lead, nickel, tin and zinc fell a total 10.6% to 41,027,075 contracts for the first nine months of this year from the same period last year. \n\"We're just seeing the beginning of it,\" a senior trader with a big U.S.-based trading house in Tokyo told Dow Jones Newswires Monday. \nLast week, N M Rothschild & Sons Ltd. said it would cease base metals trading except for its Australian business. \nChairman Evelyn de Rothschild said in a statement, \"In light of difficult trading conditions in the base metals markets, we have concluded that our limited base metals operations are no longer viable.\" \nScotiaMocatta, the base metals trading unit of Toronto-based Bank of Nova Scotia (T.BNS), said it would cut staff as well as exit LME ring dealing. \nWith ScotiaMocatta's exit, there will be 11 LME ring dealing members. These members have the exclusive right to trade in the open-outcry ring. \nEarlier, Houston-based Enron Metals said it would cut staff by 10%-20% in Europe, while associate broker clearing member Mitsui Bussan Commodities Ltd. in July ceased its market-making activities to focus on clearing and broking. \nThe senior trader said he wasn't surprised by these developments and ominously projected more to come should the difficult trading conditions continue in the next six months. \nMarket Not Pricing Future Demand \n\n\"People are really not pricing any future demand\" into their positions, he said. \nOne indication is the lack of forward pricing in LME's base metals contracts despite the current depressed prices, he said. \nWith LME three-month copper and aluminum prices around 25% down from their levels at the start of the year, he would have expected to see forward buying following previous experience. \n\"But if everybody's restructuring, you don't even know if you are going to be here into 2002, 2003,\" he said. \nDespite having tumbled to very low levels, analysts and market participants project further downside for base metals prices as they push back forecasts of a price recovery following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the U.S. \nOne of Japan's trading giants, Marubeni Corp. (J.MRB), said Monday that the attacks have pushed back the timing of the aluminum market's recovery by two to three months. \nIt also cut its forecasts for this year's trading range of the LME three-month aluminum contract to $1,250-$1,450 a metric ton, compared with last year's $1,451-$1,730/ton range. \nIndeed, the past few years have thrown base metals into extremely difficult trading conditions, traders said. \nJust as the Asian markets were recovering from the 1997 financial crisis, the U.S. economy sputtered to a halt, they said. The terrorist attacks Sept. 11 and the subsequent retaliation threw a spanner in the works, they added. \nThe bellwether copper and aluminum contracts last week fell to their lowest levels in 28 months, while zinc prices also notched 14-year lows. Tin prices are at their lowest levels in 20 years. \nA prominent casualty is the world's largest combined lead and zinc producer, Australia's Pasminco Ltd.

Times Info Ltd-Asia Africa Intel Wire. Business Line (The Hindu) Copyright (C) 2001 Kasturi & Sons Ltd. All Rights Res'd\n\nTHE exit of Enron and AES from the Indian power scene has generated worry. For, more than affecting power generation, this might have a lasting impact on the prospects of foreign direct investment in India. This is because the US is the biggest investor in India, and power generation was seen as one of the most attractive areas. But, then, this did not happen suddenly, and the portents were visible from ever since Cogentrix pulled out. \nBut despite such fears, FDI increased substantially in 2000. On an approval basis, it increased 27.5 per cent in 2000 (from $6,750 million in 1999 to $8,610 million in 2000). American investments rose 14.6 per cent (from $851.2 million in 1999 to $975.6 million in 2000).\nWhat then is the fallacy? One reason why the flows were not affected is that, overall, the FDI trend in India is not affected by any sector, no matter how important it is. Presently, the policy constraints to foreign investment are confined to select sectors, and sectoral policies are emerging the determinants of the FDI flow trend. The policies in some sectors such as power, telecommunications and oil may not be conducive, but in others, particularly manufacturing, they are comparable to any other countrys. \nEven after a decade of liberalisation, independent power producers are finding it difficult to set up operations, with the State electricity boards in financial straits. Thus, of the 50,000 MW projects approved in the private sector, only 3,000 MW were added during 1991-99. Non-transparent policies in basic, cellular and wireless local loop services are preventing foreign investors from coming into the telecom and oil refining sector sin a big way. Nothing is as yet clear about the dismantling of Administrative Price Mechanism in the petroleum sector that is scheduled for April 1, 2002. \nHowever, this is not true for other sectors. In automotive or in electrical/electronic industries, no MNC has so far pulled out. Instead, more players are coming in. As a result, the actual flow of foreign investments has been in automobile and electrical/electric equipment sectors though FDI was approved largely in power and telecommunications. \nFor instance, in 2000 nearly 30 per cent of the actual total flow of FDI was in the transport sector, mainly automobiles and electrical equipment industries against only 15 per cent flow in power, oil refinery and telecommunication. In contrast, 36 per cent of FDI was approved in transport and electrical industries against 41 per cent approved in power, oil refinery and telecommunication during 2000. The automotive sector attracted a $1.2-billion in FDI in the 1990s and grew at 20 per cent from 1991-99; the result of the flow of foreign investment and its impact on the industry. \nFurther, contradicting the fear hyped over the foreign investment prospect due to the Enron exit, a recent study by the American Chamber of Commerce reflected the US investors positive perception of Indias vast potential. According to the study, the country has the potential to attract FDI of $100 million over the next five years, if certain improvements are made in the regulatory measures and to the sectoral policies that are acting as barriers to foreign investors. \nA study by the RBI unveiled a glorified result of the business performance of foreign-invested firms in India. The study, covering 334 firms, revealed that their average return on equity was 12.5-13 per cent during 1998-99 and 1999-2000, which, in terms of global standards, is lucrative. The interesting part of the study is that the rate of return on equity in case of US-invested firms was as high as 12 per cent. Japanese and British firms, however, recorded higher returns on equity 22 per cent and 18 per cent, respectively. \nFurther, these high rates of return on equity were reaped up mostly from domestic sales, and the firms had to exert less to export, and area where competition is intensifying by the day. The study revealed that the ratio of export intensity of sales was 4-6 per cent during 1998-99 and 1999-2000. That is, these firms are garnering higher returns by selling more than 95 per cent of their production in the domestic market. In terms of industry, the RBI study revealed that not only the return on equity, but also the growth rate of returns were high in automobile and electrical industries. Thus, the attraction of these sectors and the consequent large actual flows of FDI. The return on equity in the auto industry was 14.6 per cent in 1999-2000 the second highest after pharmaceutical and the growth rate in return was 27 per cent over the previous years. \nThe return for the electrical equipment industry was 10.5 per cent in 1999-2000 and growth rate in return as high as 40 per cent over the previous year. Therefore, the barriers often highlighted for the slow pace of FDI are not strictly related to the countrys overall policy. The FDI gets bogged down because of sectoral policy constraints, each different from the other. \nThe American Chambers study admits that such macro-level factors as inflexible labour laws and poor infrastructure play a relatively less important role in encouraging foreign investment than the sectoral policy constraints. \nIt is difficult to offer an ideal investment policy. But, certainly, the country has inherent strengths such as skilled manpower, huge domestic market and a stable democratic government that are conducive to attracting foreign investments. The RBI study confirms this. It only remains to tap this potential. \nS. Majumder\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

It has asked the promoters to bring in this amount. \nThe intransigence of the lenders has left MOL and SCI with the difficult task of not only paying Enron off, but also bringing in the Dollars 55m debt amount, if they are to take delivery of the vessel on the scheduled date next month. \nThe SCI board has had extensive discussions on the subject, but failed to come to a consensus on putting in the extra funds. And during discussions held in London recently, MOL had clearly told the lenders it was not in favour of putting in extra funds to salvage the LNG shipping deal. \nMOL feels the economics do not justify the extra expenditure. The consortium is now facing a charter hire rate of Dollars 60,000-Dollars 65,000 per day, compared with the rate of Dollars 98,600 initially negotiated with the Dabhol Power Company. \nIf one took a daily charter hire rate of Dollars 60,000, Greenfield would earn around Dollars 22m per annum, of which Dollars 4-Dollars 5m would be spent on operating expenses of the tanker. \nThat would leave Dollars 17-Dollars 18m, yielding an internal rate of return (IRR) of just 7%-8% for MOL on its 60% equity stake. This would be unacceptable for the Japanese line. \nFor SCI, the IRR would be even lower - 4%-4.5%, far below the Indian government norm of 12% for projects involving state funding.\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Since 1999, we have been proud to offer you free membership and no-cost usership. WineCommune now has the second largest membership base and it is the third largest Internet wine auction company by volume. We have built a business that is secure and reputable, with a client base of loyal users whose participation and feedback have helped us become what we are today.\n\nWe want to go further and provide you with an even better place on the Internet to buy and sell wine. We want to add more features, make the site faster, and make it more secure. In order to do that, however, we have to begin charging a modest commission. Beginning with lots posted on Monday, November 5, 2001, sellers will be charged a 3% commission for all successful auctions. Bidding and buying will remain free - fees only apply to the seller. The new fees are the lowest in the wine auction industry - online or offline. Other wine auctions charge as much as 12% to the buyer AND 12% to the seller.\n\nWhat are we going to do with the commission?  Over the next several months look for the following new services:\n\n1. Increased advertising to attract new members\n2. Enhanced customer service\n3. Platinum Seller Program - a way to reward sellers with proven track records\n4. Greater protection for buyers\n5. New ways to buy and sell\n\nWe believe the new charge to sellers is competitive and fair, and hope you agree. With this change, we are committed to providing you with the fastest and easiest method for selling and buying wine. Please continue to provide us with comments and suggestions on ways of enhancing our service. We value your membership and are grateful for your continued patronage and support. Thank you for helping us make WineCommune the #1 wine auction community.\n\nIf you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact us at contact@winecommune.com.\n\nThe WineCommune Staff\n"

The Houston-based business, whose stock has fallen 75\npercent this year amid concerns about failed investments, depends\non a $3 billion commercial paper, or short-term debt, program to\nfinance day-to-day operations.\n\n     Earlier this month, Moody's Investors Service placed all $13\nbillion of the company's long-term debt securities on watch for\npossible downgrade. As a second-tier commercial paper borrower,\nany drop in its rating may cut off Enron from the commercial paper\nmarket and raise the costs of short-term debt.\n\n     ``We understand that our credit rating is critical to both\nthe capital markets and our counterparties,'' Enron's Chief\nFinancial Officer Andrew Fastow said on a conference call today.\nHe said Enron has $3.5 billion available on bank credit lines,\ngiving it enough cash to operate normally.\n\n     Enron shares rose as much as 12.6 percent during the call to\n$23.25. They pared the gain to $21.80, up $1.15.\n\n     Dan Noonan, a spokesman for Citigroup's Citibank NA unit,\ndeclined to comment. Mark Palmer, a spokesman for Enron, declined\nto comment.\n\n                      Commercial Paper Rates\n\n     Enron was paying 3.15 percent to issue commercial paper until\nOct. 31, which is as much as 15 basis points more than companies\nwith the same ``A2/P2'' short-term credit ratings that are not on\ncredit watch. Enron's short-term debt is not on review for a\npossible downgrade.\n\n     Enron has previously turned to Citigroup for finance and\nadvice. In 1999, Citigroup's Salomon Smith Barney unit advised the\ncompany on its $1.45 billion acquisition of three natural gas-\nfired power plants from Cogen Technologies Inc. Citibank, along\nwith J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., this year arranged a $1.75 billion\nloan.\n\n     Earlier this week, an investor sued Enron, saying two\npartnerships cost the company $35 million and Fastow's leadership\nof them was a conflict of interest.\n\n     The SEC has asked Enron about partnerships and affiliated\ncompanies headed by Fastow. Dismantling some of the partnerships\nwould cost Enron or its shareholders as much as $3 billion, Ray\nNiles, a Salomon Smith Barney analyst, wrote in a report to\ninvestors.\n\n     Enron created partnerships and affiliated companies to buy\nand sell assets such as power plants to lower the debt on its\nbooks.\n\n     Investors said they were concerned that Enron may be forced\nto dismantle the affiliated companies by paying off the owners in\ncash or stock. Chief Executive Ken Lay said last week he may have\nto ``unravel'' agreements that created the companies if Enron's\ndebt ratings fall too far.\n\n--Mark Lake in the New York newsroom (212) 893-5989 or\n\n\nEnron Corp. Cut to `Reduce' at Edward Jones\n2001-10-23 11:42 (New York)\n\n     Princeton, New Jersey, Oct. 23 (Bloomberg Data) -- Enron Corp. (ENE US)\nwas downgraded to ``reduce'' from ``accumulate'' by analyst Zach Wagner at\nEdward Jones.\n\n--Michael O. Donohue in Princeton, New Jersey, (+1)609-279-3756.\n\n\n\nEnron CFO: Company Has Sufficient Liquidity\nBy Christina Cheddar\nOf DOW JONES NEWSWIRES\n\n10/23/2001\nDow Jones News Service\n(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)\n\nNEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay said the company had procedures in place to avoid conflicts of interest in dealings between Enron and partnerships that were set up and run by its chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. \nLast week, the Securities and Exchange Commission asked the Houston energy trading company to provide additional information about the partnerships, which Enron said were off-balance sheet financing vehicles used to hedge against fluctuations in the market.\nIn a conference call held Monday to discuss investor concerns about the SEC investigation and related matters, Lay said there was a \"Chinese wall\" in place to protect the interest of Enron shareholders. \nThe procedures were \"rigorously followed,\" Lay said. \nIn previous filings with the SEC, Enron said the terms of the transactions with the partnerships were \"reasonable compared to those which could have been negotiated with unrelated third parties.\" \nFastow resigned from the partnerships, which were known as LJM Cayman LP and LJM2 Co-Investments LP in late July. \nThe company also is involved in other off-balance sheet financing vehicles, including Marlin Water Trust II and Whitewing. \nDuring the conference call, investors said they were frustrated by the complex nature of the trusts, and asked for more information. \nLay said the company would be providing a list of \"Frequently Asked Questions\" on its Web site later Tuesday that may provide more details. \nAfter Enron disclosed the SEC investigation Monday, the company's stock sunk to its lowest level in 52 weeks, $19.67. Enron shares were recently trading up 47 cents, or 2.3%, at $21.12, in brisk volume that has already surpassed its average daily turnover of 6.3 million shares. \nLay said he was \"extremely disappointed\" in the current stock price. \n\"Our businesses are performing very well and we are continuing to conduct business,\" he said. \n\nDuring the conference call, Enron officials declined to specify Fastow's role in the partnership, citing the ongoing SEC investigation and a derivative lawsuit filed against Enron that alleges its board breached its fiduciary duties by allowing Fastow to create and run the partnerships. \nEnron officials also addressed concerns that investors had about the potential need to issue additional Enron stock. \nUnder certain circumstances, for example, if both Enron's stock and credit rating fall to certain levels, the company would need to issue additional shares to the partnerships, diluting the holdings of current shareholders. \nEnron officials declined to say how much dilution would occur under a \"worst-case scenario.\" \nHowever, the officials said they doubted there would be a need to issue the additional stock because the company plans to work with the credit-rating agencies to prevent such an event. \nMoody's put Enron on watch for a downgrade of its long-term debt last week after the company announced a $1 billion third-quarter write-off that produced a $618 million loss. \nAccording to Lay, Enron's debt rating would need to fall several notches to below investment grade in order to trigger the need to issue more stock. \n\"We are committed to maintaining our ratings,\" Lay said. \"Moody's said they would work with us,\" he added. \nFurthermore, Fastow said, Enron expects to have \"sufficient liquidity\" to meet all its capital requirements. \n\nEnron's efforts to unwind the LJM partnerships contributed to a reduction of $1.2 billion in shareholder equity. However, Enron's Lay said the lower number of shares outstanding wouldn't affect the company's earnings outlook. \nEnron has said it expects to earn $1.80 a share in 2001 and $2.15 a share in 2002. The numbers are in line with the consensus estimates reported by Thomson Financial/First Call. \n\"Despite the economy going softer, we think we can meet that,\" Lay said. \n-By Christina Cheddar, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-5166; christina.cheddar@dowjones.com\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Enron's shareholders best interests were sought in all LJM dealings,\" said Enron chief executive officer Kenneth Lay, in a conference call with analysts.\nThe company scheduled the call after Enron's stock slid 21 pct yesterday, when it revealed the Securities and Exchange Commission asked the company to provide information on certain related-party transactions. \nOvernight, two class action lawsuits were launched by shareholders against Enron and its officers, alleging that operating results were also \"materially overstated\" as a result of the company failing to timely write-down the value. \nIn its third-quarter results last week, Enron announced a charge of 1.01 bln usd, of 1.11 usd per share, and an incremental 1.2 bln usd reduction in stockholders' equity, related to the unwinding of investments with the LJM partnerships. \nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, Fastow resigned from the partnerships in July, due to growing suspicion over potential conflicts of interests. \nDuring the call, Lay said that he, and Enron's board of directors, have \"the highest faith and confidence in (Fastow).\" \nLay also said the company remained confident that its current liquidity position allows it to meet all its obligations, and is confident of the outlook for its corporate rating. \nAnalysts have raised the possibility that, should Enron's credit rating and stock price continue to fall, the company may be obligated to issue millions of new shares to meet obligations with other entities it deals with. \nng/cml For more information and to contact AFX: www.afxnews.com and www.afxpress.com\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The suit additionally alleges that Enron was failing to write-down impaired assets on a timely basis in accordance with GAAP. \nOn Oct 16, Enron announced unexpectedly that it was taking third quarter non-recurring charges of 1.01 bln after-tax, or 1.11 usd per share, which it later revealed was due largely to the unwinding of investments with certain limited partnerships controlled by Enron's chief financial officer. Enron also announced it was cutting shareholder equity by 1.2 bln usd. \nEnron's share price consequently fell sharply. During the class period, Enron insiders disposed of 73 mln usd of personally-held Enron common stock. \nHolders of Enron stock between the class period in question may request appointment as a lead plaintiff no later than Dec 21, Milberg Weiss said. \nYesterday, Enron announced that the Securities and Exchange Commission has requested that it provide information regarding certain related party transactions. \njkm/shw For more information and to contact AFX: www.afxnews.com and www.afxpress.com\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

All Rights Reserved.\n\nNEW YORK - Shares of Enron Corp. slumped more than 20% yesterday after it said U.S. regulators are looking into company transactions, another blow to a company whose chief executive resigned in August. \nA spokesman for North America's biggest buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity declined to discuss an inquiry by the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission, but said it was cooperating.\nThe SEC also declined to outline details of its inquiry. \nInvestor confidence in the company has been rocked by reports from The Wall Street Journal about its relationship with two limited partnerships that were run until recently by Enron's chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. \nThe company also reported last week its first quarterly loss in more than four years, and took US$1.01-billion in charges and writedowns on ill-fated investments. \nProblems at Enron surfaced two months ago when CEO Jeff Skilling resigned after six months at the helm. \nEnron shares declined US$5.49, or 21%, to US$20.56 in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, shaving off almost US$4.2-billion of its market capitalization. \nThe stock, the biggest decliner by percentage loss on the NYSE, fell as much as 22.8% yesterday, when it opened at its lowest level since September 1998. \nEnron declined to comment on whether the SEC's inquiry into \"certain related-party transactions\" involved the partnerships. \n\"Related-party transactions\" is the heading used by Enron in its 1999 and 2000 annual reports to discuss dealings with its limited partnerships, LJM Cayman LP and the larger LJM2 Co-Investment LP, which engaged in complex hedging transactions involving company assets worth hundreds of millions of dollars. \nMr. Fastow severed his ties with the partnerships in June. LJM was set up in June 1999 for energy-related investments, and LJM2 in December 1999 for energy- and communication-related investments. \nThe Journal reported US$35-million of its third-quarter loss of US$638-million were connected with the limited partnerships \nCurt Launer, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston, said investors should question Enron's use of real value accounting when the value of certain assets, \"most notably in telecommunications,\" have declined precipitously. \n\"Investors have had several opportunities to question Enron's credibility and at each of those turns the share price has declined,\" Launer said. \nSome analysts, though, cautioned against assuming fire when there might only be smoke. \n\"This is an inquiry, not an investigation, and I cannot imagine Enron's attorneys or accountants would allow it do to something illegal,\" said Merrill Lynch analyst Donato Eassey. \n\"It's easy for the market to kick a company when its down, but these challenges do not last for a solid company, and we think Enron is one.\" \nThe price of shares in the company is down 75% this year.\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. \t\n\nCity - SEC inquiry sparks Enron share fall.\nBy Simon English.\n\n10/23/2001\nThe Daily Telegraph\nP31\n(c) Telegraph Group Limited, London, 2001\n\nin New York \nENRON, the American power giant, saw its shares slump by a fifth yesterday after it revealed that the top financial watchdog is delving into firms managed by chief financial officer Andrew Fastow.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission is requesting details of deals between the company and limited partnerships with which Mr Fastow has, or had, links. \nEnron chairman Kenneth Lay said in a statement: \"We welcome this request. We will co-operate fully and look forward to the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to rest.\" \nQuestions were raised last week on Wall Street after the company announced a write-down of more than $1 billion due to failed investments in telecoms and other businesses. \nThe disclosure alarmed investors and sent the already battered shares down 23pc. Yesterday they fell another $5.30 ( #3.80) to $20.75 in early trading. \nAccording to the annual report the \"related party transactions\", as Enron describes them, took place in 1999 and 2000, resulting in losses of $16m and $36m respectively. \nMr Lay said that auditors approved the deals, but would not give further details of what they were. \nThey are understood to have been hedging transactions against Enron shares and other assets made by partnerships called LJM Cayman LP and LJM2 Co-Investment JP. \n\"We believe everything that needed to be considered and done in connection with these transactions was considered and done,\" added Mr Lay. \nThe relationship between the investment losses and the SEC probe is not clear, though the inquiry seems to focus on the partnerships responsible for the hedging transactions. \nEnron owns Teesside Power Station and Wessex Water in Britain and is the largest trader of natural gas in the US. Investors are concerned that the probe and the continued uncertainty about the extent of the problem will harm the company's credit rating. \nAn Enron spokesman said Mr Fastow continues to work and is not under any suspicion. \nThe SEC inquiry is \"informal\", says the company. The watchdog contacted Enron last Wednesday, the day of the results announcement. The SEC declined to comment. \nEnron made a loss of $638m in the third quarter, its first in over four years.\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. \t\n\nBusiness; Financial Desk\nShares of Enron Plummet 21% Energy: SEC requests information from company on series of unusual financial deals tied to executive.\nNANCY RIVERA BROOKS\nTIMES STAFF WRITER\n\n10/23/2001\nLos Angeles Times\nHome Edition\nC-1\nCopyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company\n\nShares of Enron Corp. set a 52-week low Monday on word that the Securities and Exchange Commission had asked for information about a complex series of financial transactions between the Houston-based energy giant and an investment partnership tied to a company executive. \nEnron, the world's largest energy trader, said it had voluntarily provided information on \"certain related-party transactions\" that had been previously disclosed to the SEC.\n\"We welcome this request,\" said Kenneth L. Lay, Enron chairman and chief executive. \n\"We will cooperate fully with the SEC and look forward to the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to rest,\" he said. \nThe SEC request is the latest in a parade of bad news for Enron, which has seen investments sour in telecommunications, retail electricity sales and water. \nInvestors have battered the company's stock, which once sold for nearly $85 a share in the last year, and many have criticized Enron's stingy meting out of financial information. But several Wall Street analysts remain upbeat on the stock, noting that the bulk of its businesses continue to thrive despite the growing economic downturn. \nIn August, Enron Chief Executive Jeffrey K. Skilling, one of the main architects of the company's strategy of shedding physical assets in search of trading profit, stunned Wall Street by resigning. \nSkilling cited personal, family-related reasons, but later he acknowledged that the precipitous plunge in the company's stock price contributed to his departure. \nOn Monday, Enron shares plunged $5.40, or nearly 21%, to close at $20.65 on the New York Stock Exchange. \nEnron's stock has lost nearly 40% of its value in the last week since it reported a surprise third-quarter loss of $618 million after $1.01 billion in charges reflecting the costs of recent failed investments. \nBut the charge also included $35 million related to what Enron described only as the \"early termination during the third quarter of certain structured finance arrangements with a previously disclosed entity.\" \nIn a conference call with securities analysts about the earnings, the company mentioned that it had repurchased 55 million shares as part of the dissolution of its participation in the transactions. \nBut investors were stunned when stories last week in the Wall Street Journal detailed that the transactions were with a limited partnership organized by Andrew S. Fastow, Enron's chief financial officer, and that Enron had whittled $1.2 billion off its shareholder equity as it repurchased the shares and canceled a $1.2-billion note it had received from the partnership. Shareholder equity now stands at $9.5 billion. \nThe limited partnership, called LJM2, and Fastow reaped millions of dollars of profit through complex hedging transactions that involved Enron assets and stock, the Journal reported. \nLay said the transactions were reviewed by auditors and lawyers inside and outside the company and that the company board was fully informed. \nA shareholder lawsuit charging that Enron's directors violated their fiduciary duty already has been filed in Texas state court. \nMany companies set up limited partnerships for tax purposes, but it is unusual to allow company executives to run them, analyst say. \nInvestors also are upset by the unusually zealous way that Enron has guarded financial information, making it difficult to analyze the company's complex web of businesses. \nAnd many are not confident that all the bad news has been released. \nAnalyst M. Carol Coale, who follows Enron and other energy companies for Prudential Securities in Houston, downgraded Enron to a \"hold\" from a \"buy\" rating Monday out of such frustration. \nCoale said she has been getting misinformation or no information out of Enron. \nBut Bob Christensen, energy analyst with First Albany Corp., said that despite Enron's recent difficulties, the bulk of the business remains strong. \n\"I continue to tell investors that 70% of this company's business is growing at a 26% rate, and that was in the third quarter when this country had a very sharp economic slowdown going on,\" he said. \nInvestors are panicking because of a \"bad news story that doesn't reflect reality,\" said Jon Kyle Cartwright, senior energy analyst with the Raymond James & Associates brokerage firm in St. Petersburg, Fla. \n\"They are the world's largest energy trader, and they are very good at that,\" Cartwright said. \n\"The reality is that everything is fine here,\" although more charges, perhaps $500 million worth, are expected in the next few quarters, related to businesses that Enron is selling.\n\nGRAPHIC: Losing Its Spark / Los Angeles Times; \nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

It is a sign that investors are willing to pay a rich price f=\nor option protection and expect the stock to be unsettled as the Houston co=\nmpany sorts through its credit and debt problems and seeks to calm frazzled=\n investors.=20\nEnron near-month defensive puts traded heavily in an otherwise quiet sessio=\nn Wednesday, as investors bought them to hedge. The December 5 puts traded =\nmore than 10,000 contracts and jumped 45 cents to $1.10 at the Chicago Boar=\nd Options Exchange. The stock closed down $1.98, or 28%, to $5.01, as of 4 =\np.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.\nEnron's calls traded actively as some investors sold them to generate incom=\ne. Traders noted some call buying -- especially after Enron procured a thre=\ne-week extension on a $690 million note -- as some hopeful investors bet on=\n Enron pulling through its troubles and proceeding with its merger with Dyn=\negy Inc. Enron's December 5 calls traded more than 14,500 contracts, compar=\ned with open interest of 710, as they fell $1.45 to $1.15 at the CBOE.=20\nFor investors who want to book a tax loss on beaten-down stocks, the \"wash =\nsale\" rule can be a hurdle, because it essentially prevents taxpayers from =\nselling stock or securities at a loss and then reacquiring \"substantially i=\ndentical\" securities within a 30-day period before or after that loss. This=\n poses a problem for those who want to book a loss yet own stocks whose pri=\nces now make them attractive \"buy\" candidates.=20\nIn addition, the Internal Revenue Service has taken the position that the w=\nash-sale rule will disallow a loss if the investor sells an in-the-money pu=\nt, because there is a strong likelihood that stock will be put to or acquir=\ned by the investor.=20\nSo investors typically get around the wash-sale rule by \"doubling up\": buyi=\nng additional stock or options, waiting at least 31 days, and then selling =\nthe original stock to book the loss. Investors double up by buying calls, w=\nhich locks a price to buy stock and achieves the same effect as buying addi=\ntional stock.\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Emshwiller\nStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal\n\n11/23/2001\nThe Wall Street Journal\nA3\n(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)\n\nEven as it reiterated its intention to purchase Enron Corp., Dynegy Inc. is=\n coming under increasing pressure to renegotiate or walk away from the mult=\nibillion-dollar deal.=20\nThe pressure is stemming from the continuing slide in the price of Enron sh=\nares and the mounting financial problems at the Houston energy-trading comp=\nany, the nation's biggest marketer of electricity and natural gas. During t=\nhe past month, Enron has taken a $1 billion write-off of assets, revised do=\nwnward the earnings of the past several years and taken a $1.2 billion redu=\nction in shareholder equity.\nThe problems have been due largely to dealings Enron had with private partn=\nerships, run by some of its own executives, under investigation by the Secu=\nrities and Exchange Commission. In an SEC filing Monday, Enron disclosed hu=\nndreds of millions of potential additional write-offs as well as the possib=\nility that its weakening financial condition could force it to repay more t=\nhan $2 billion in loans by the end of the year.=20\nAs of 4 p.m. Wednesday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron =\nshares fell $1.98, or 28%, to $5.01 each after having dropped 23% Tuesday. =\nIn excess of 115 million shares traded Wednesday, more than four times the =\nvolume of any other Big Board stock. Enron's bonds also again traded sharpl=\ny lower, market observers said.=20\nThe turmoil spilled over to Dynegy's stock, which also was among the most a=\nctively traded on the New York Stock Exchange. As of 4 p.m. Wednesday, Dyne=\ngy shares fell $1.94 to $39.76 each.=20\nOn Wednesday, Dynegy issued a statement in which Chairman and Chief Executi=\nve Chuck Watson said his company was working \"to accelerate the regulatory =\napprovals required to complete the merger in accordance with the previously=\n announced agreement\" though it continued to perform \"due diligence\" on Enr=\non.=20\nUnder the merger agreement, Dynegy has opportunities to renegotiate or walk=\n away from the deal if Enron's financial and legal problems become severe e=\nnough. However, some observers said it can be difficult to invoke these so-=\ncalled material adverse change clauses. They point to a decision earlier th=\nis year by a Delaware Chancery Court judge who forced Tyson Foods Inc. to c=\nomplete a planned purchase of IBP Inc. even though Tyson, a Springdale, Ark=\n., food-products company, had wanted to cancel the transaction because of a=\n drop in IBP's earnings and accounting problems at an IBP unit.=20\nDynegy officials didn't return calls seeking comment. To complete the deal,=\n two-thirds of Dynegy shareholders and a majority of Enron shareholders wou=\nld have to give their approval. No dates for those votes have been set.=20\nOne person familiar with the merger plans said the SEC filing Monday by Enr=\non contained information Dynegy hadn't known about. Dynegy representatives =\nplanned to work through the weekend evaluating the importance of this new i=\nnformation as part of the company's due diligence, this person said. It cou=\nldn't be determined what the new information was.=20\nThe merger agreement, announced Nov. 9, calls for Dynegy to exchange 0.2685=\n share for each of Enron's roughly 850 million fully diluted shares, giving=\n the purchase a value of about $9 billion at Dynegy's current stock price. =\nHowever, from a price standpoint, the deal is appearing less attractive to =\nDynegy.=20\nOn the day of the merger announcement, Enron shares were trading at about $=\n8.63 each, or about 83% of the purchase price under the exchange ratio. As =\nof Wednesday, Enron's market price was only about 47% of the merger-formula=\n price. Such a sharp deterioration is unusual following a merger announceme=\nnt, when the stock price of the company being acquired generally begins tra=\nding relatively close to the offering price.=20\nSentiment among Wall Street analysts also is turning against the merger. In=\nitially, many analysts lauded the merger as a move that would rescue Enron =\nand provide a major boost to Houston-based Dynegy. Dynegy and Enron officia=\nls have predicted that the merger, supposed to be completed late next year,=\n would significantly and immediately increase Dynegy's earnings.=20\nNow analysts are challenging that assumption. Ron Barone, managing director=\n at UBS Warburg LLC, said he believes that because of Enron's financial pro=\nblems, a combined company would actually have lower earnings next year than=\n Dynegy would have by itself. Mr. Barone said he thinks a \"likely scenario\"=\n is that the merger formula will be renegotiated sharply down to about 0.15=\n Dynegy share for each Enron share.=20\nSuch a ratcheting down wouldn't be without precedent in the deal. According=\n to one person familiar with the merger negotiations, Dynegy reduced the ex=\nchange formula at least once prior to the Nov. 9 announcement because of En=\nron's rapidly sinking stock price, which at the beginning of this year was =\nabove $80 a share.=20\nIn perhaps the most significant sign of the turning tide on Wall Street, Go=\nldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer lowered his ratings on Enron and Dynegy=\n. A longtime Enron fan, Mr. Fleischer issued a report expressing doubts tha=\nt the merger would help Dynegy's earnings and whether Enron could \"recover =\nthe significant business that has been lost\" in its giant energy-trading op=\nerations. \"The Enron machine continues to sputter,\" Mr. Fleischer wrote.=20\nSome observers say that if Dynegy walked away from the deal or tried to ren=\negotiate the terms significantly, Enron might be pushed into a bankruptcy-l=\naw filing. Without the Dynegy acquisition and continued support from its ba=\nnkers and customers, an Enron bankruptcy-court filing \"is highly possible,\"=\n said Ralph Pellecchia, a senior director at Fitch, a credit-ratings agency=\n. On Wednesday, Fitch maintained its credit rating on Enron at just one not=\nch above noninvestment-grade, or \"junk,\" status. But Fitch also said it bel=\nieved Enron's trading partners had made \"significant cash collateral calls\"=\n in recent days that are \"well in excess of previous expectations,\" contrib=\nuting to \"liquidity pressures.\"=20\nAmong the advisers Enron has hired during its current crisis is the law fir=\nm of Weil, Gotshal & Manges, which specializes in bankruptcy and corporate-=\nworkout situations. Asked about a possible bankruptcy filing, an Enron spok=\neswoman said the company expects the Dynegy deal to go through and therefor=\ne doesn't expect to have to look at alternatives to the merger. Since the m=\nerger announcement, Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay has said his company had alt=\nernatives to the Dynegy deal but he has declined to identify them. Enron sa=\nid it made some progress improving its financial position. The company said=\n it reached a final agreement with units of J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Cit=\nigroup Inc. on the remaining $450 million of a previously announced $1 bill=\nion in secured credit lines. Enron said lenders had agreed to extend repaym=\nent of an existing $690 million note to mid-December from next week. The sp=\nokeswoman said a restructuring of that obligation is expected to be complet=\ned next month so that repayment wouldn't be required this year.=20\n---=20\nThaddeus Herrick and Robin Sidel contributed to this article.\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Amid growing disclosur=\nes of financial problems in recent weeks, the company \"locked down\" the ret=\nirement plan from Oct. 17 to Nov. 19 to make administrative changes, which =\nprevented employees from selling Enron shares as the share price collapsed.\nEnron, which recently agreed to be acquired by Dynegy Inc., Houston, becaus=\ne of mounting financial problems, has seen its stock price fall to $5.01 on=\n Wednesday from a peak of nearly $90 a share last year. The decline has bee=\nn costly to participants in Enron's retirement plan because more than 60% o=\nf the 401(k) assets were invested in Enron shares at the end of last year, =\naccording to one of the suits.=20\nThe first suit was filed Nov. 13 on behalf of plan participants by Campbell=\n Harrison & Wright LLP, a Houston law firm, and the second was filed Tuesda=\ny by Seattle-based Hagens Berman LLP. Both seek class-action certification.=\n=20\nEnron said its corporate policy is not to comment on pending lawsuits. A sp=\nokeswoman also said the company's 401(k) plan offers participants 18 invest=\nment choices, one of which is company stock.=20\nThe company's stock has fallen amid mounting losses and disclosures that it=\n had extensive off-balance-sheet dealings with a web of partnerships headed=\n by former company officials. The Securities and Exchange Commission has la=\nunched a formal investigation into the company's accounting, and Enron has =\nsaid it will restate years of financial information.=20\nThe suits against Enron are the latest of a series of suits filed against c=\nompanies over losses in the company-stock portion of their 401(k) plans. Th=\ne suits allege the plan trustees breached their fiduciary duties by continu=\ning to offer company stock, even after they became aware of serious busines=\ns problems that would hurt the stock price. All the suits are pending.=20\nAs with most of these companies, Enron matches employee contributions to th=\ne 401(k) with shares of Enron stock, and also offers Enron stock as an inve=\nstment choice, in addition to a variety of mutual funds. About $1.3 billion=\n of the plan's $2.1 billion in assets was invested in Enron shares at the e=\nnd of 2000, according to the suit filed by Campbell Harrison.=20\nPamela Tittle, a participant in the 401(k) plan who worked in the finance d=\nepartment and a named plaintiff in the Enron suit filed by Campbell Harriso=\nn & Wright, had roughly 2,000 shares of Enron stock in her retirement accou=\nnt and has suffered losses of about $140,000 as a result of the stock's dec=\nline. The suit alleges that the trustees of the Enron 401(k) plan violated =\ntheir fiduciary duties by not informing plan participants that the company =\nstock was in peril.=20\nThe suit filed by Hagens Berman, also alleges that the company failed to wa=\nrn participants about risks of remaining invested in Enron stock. In additi=\non, it accuses Enron of systematically misrepresenting its financial result=\ns since 1998 in connection with the partnerships under investigation by the=\n SEC.=20\nRoy E. Rinard, a lineman for Enron in Oregon who is a named plaintiff in th=\ne suit filed by Hagens Berman, has seen the value of his retirement plan fa=\nll to $70,000 from $470,000, largely as a result of the decline in Enron's =\nstock. \"I feel like I have been betrayed,\" Mr. Rinard said in press release=\n issued by his lawyers. \"I lost my savings, my plans for the future, everyt=\nhing.\"=20\nUnder federal pension law, companies are allowed to offer their own stock i=\nn retirement plans, and are allowed to force employees to hold onto the sto=\nck. Enron doesn't let employees diversify out of shares they receive as mat=\nching contributions to the 401(k) plan until age 50.=20\nHowever, plan trustees are supposed to operate the plan in the best interes=\nts of the participants, which includes choosing prudent investments. Genera=\nlly, to prove that the plan's administrators breached their fiduciary dutie=\ns, employees must show that the trustees knew the stock was a bad investmen=\nt. This presents a high hurdle, so it is not surprising that prior lawsuits=\n over losses in company stock in 401(k) plans have generally come in the wa=\nke of allegations of accounting irregularities.=20\nLynn Sarko, one of Ms. Tittle's attorneys with Seattle's Keller Rohrback LL=\nP, is also co-lead counsel in a similar lawsuit against Lucent Technologies=\n Inc., Murray Hill, N.J. Another firm representing Ms. Tittle is Dalton Got=\nto Samson & Kilgard PLC, which is lead counsel in a similar suit against Ik=\non Office Solutions Inc., Malvern, Pa. The two law firms are representing M=\ns. Tittle with Campbell Harrison & Wright.=20\nThe suits against Lucent and Ikon, like the suit against Enron, allege that=\n then-current plan trustees kept offering company stock in the plan despite=\n knowing of serious business problems that would hurt the stock price. Repr=\nesentatives for Ikon and Lucent say their companies didn't require employee=\ns to invest in the company stock, and educated employees about the need for=\n diversification.=20\nThe suit in which Mr. Rinard is plaintiff notes that on Oct. 17, a day afte=\nr Enron announced the company was taking a nonrecurring charge totaling $1.=\n01 billion in the third quarter, Enron \"locked down\" the 401(k) plan's asse=\nts, preventing participants from selling Enron shares. (A \"lock-down\" occur=\ns when a retirement plan is transferred from one administrator to another, =\nand generally lasts several weeks, during which time participants can't mak=\ne changes in their investment choices).=20\nThe lock-down was lifted on Nov. 19. In the interim, on Nov. 8, Enron annou=\nnced it would be forced to restate downward its reported financial results =\nfrom 1997 through 2000. By the time the lock-down was lifted, as a result o=\nf all the negative news the shares had fallen to below $9 a share from $32.=\n20 on Oct. 17, when the lockup started, Hagens Berman attorney Karl Barth s=\naid.=20\n\"They were locked into it right when Enron knew it was going to be announci=\nng some really bad news,\" Mr. Barth said. \"Mr. Rinard's looking at having n=\no retirement savings now.

The Securities =\nand Exchange Commission filed civil fraud complaints against the Andersen p=\nartner who audited Sunbeam and against the firm itself in the Waste Managem=\nent case.=20\nNow Enron has repudiated the financial statements that were certified by Ar=\nthur Andersen, in the process shaving more than half a billion dollars from=\n the company's reported profits in recent years.\nAll of which raises the question: Has Arthur Andersen become the black shee=\np of the accounting industry?=20\nIt is not an easy question to answer, and not everyone is willing to rush t=\no judgment. ''If you want to attack Andersen for Enron, you need to know mo=\nre than we know,'' Arthur Levitt, the former chairman of the Securities and=\n Exchange Commission, said this week.=20\nBut if there is a thread connecting what is known about the three cases, it=\n is materiality. In all three cases, Andersen auditors spotted bad accounti=\nng but were persuaded it was immaterial and therefore allowed it to go ahea=\nd.=20\nMateriality is one of those flexible concepts that can get accountants into=\n trouble. The idea is that it doesn't much matter if a few little things we=\nre gotten wrong. But they can add up.=20\nAt Enron, however, they did not add up to that much -- a total of $93 milli=\non over four years. The biggest restatement of Enron profits concerns a rel=\nated party that Enron now says should have been consolidated. It is not cle=\nar if Andersen had the facts needed to make that decision at the time.=20\nTo those who treasure the role of auditors, the humiliation of Andersen is =\npainful. Back in the 1950's, it was Leonard Spacek, Andersen's managing par=\ntner, who warned that ''the profession's existence is in peril'' because it=\n was not showing enough independence. His public prodding was crucial in ma=\nking the industry do a better job. Two decades ago, when the issue on the t=\nable was pension accounting, Andersen was the only major accounting firm to=\n break with clients and push for good rules.=20\nNow Andersen's backbone is open to question. It was evidence that senior pe=\nople at Andersen repeatedly gave in to pressure from Waste Management that =\nled the S.E.C. to bring that suit, which the firm chose to settle without a=\ndmitting it had done anything wrong. The partner that the S.E.C. says looke=\nd the other way at Sunbeam is fighting the accusations, and Andersen says h=\ne acted properly.=20\nLynn Turner, who was chief accountant of the S.E.C. at the time and is now =\ndirector of the Center for Quality Financial Reporting at Colorado State Un=\niversity, says what is happening to Andersen now is reminiscent of what hap=\npened to Coopers & Lybrand when he was a partner there and the firm had a s=\neries of highly publicized blown audits.=20\n''We got bludgeoned to death in the press,'' he said. ''People did not even=\n want to see us at their doorsteps. It was brutal, but we deserved it. We h=\nad gotten into this mentality in the firm of making business judgment calls=\n.'' By that he meant that the firm paid too much attention to not offending=\n clients and not enough to good accounting.=20\nFor Andersen to avoid that fate, its relatively new chief executive, Joseph=\n Berardino, who declined to be interviewed for this column, will need to se=\nt a tone inside the firm making clear that he expects auditors to show the =\nbackbone that Mr. Spacek epitomized. And then he will have to convince the =\npublic of that.\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. =09\n\n\n\nBusiness/Financial Desk; Section C\nChase and J. P. Morgan's Paper Anniversary\nA Year After the Merger, Rosy Plans Meet Reality\nBy RIVA D. ATLAS\n\n11/23/2001\nThe New York Times\nPage 1, Column 5\nc. 2001 New York Times Company\n\nWhen William B. Harrison Jr. speaks of last year's $31 billion merger of J.=\n P. Morgan and the Chase Manhattan Corporation, he speaks proudly of a deal=\n that he considers to be a capstone to his 34-year career of helping build =\na giant of the banking business.=20\n''This is the first merger I've been part of,'' said Mr. Harrison, the chie=\nf executive of the combined bank, ''where I feel our core business is compl=\nete.''\nThe Chase-J. P. Morgan combination helped advance the bank into the investm=\nent banking elite, just as Mr. Harrison intended. But with Wall Street and =\nthe economy in far different places today than they were when the deal was =\nput together, the many mergers, stock sales and other money-making opportun=\nities that were supposed to justify the high-priced acquisition have largel=\ny dried up for now.=20\nConsequently, deal makers and analysts who follow the bank are already spec=\nulating that Mr. Harrison, 58, may ultimately be compelled to do yet anothe=\nr large deal, this time to diversify his business away from its heavy empha=\nsis on Wall Street.=20\nJ. P. Morgan Chase has won some prominent assignments, like handling the re=\nvampings of troubled giants like Lucent and, more recently, Enron, the bele=\naguered energy trading company.=20\nBut while J. P. Morgan Chase is proud of serving alongside Citigroup as bot=\nh lead lender and adviser to Enron on its acquisition by Dynegy, the dual r=\nole it has worked to achieve sometimes proves complicated for the bank. Wit=\nh Enron's shares in free fall as more information comes out about its hidde=\nn debts, J. P. Morgan Chase has been scrambling to maintain the support of =\nother banks while simultaneously keeping the merger with Dynegy on track.=\n=20\nThanks largely to the slump on Wall Street, J. P. Morgan Chase's profits fe=\nll by two-thirds in the third quarter, to $449 million from $1.4 billion in=\n the period a year ago. Its stock has dropped 15 percent this year, more th=\nan other banks' shares. The bank's stock is ahead of investment banks like =\nGoldman Sachs, with which J. P. Morgan Chase increasingly competes.=20\n''The jury is still out in many respects on this merger,'' said Judah Kraus=\nhaar, an analyst at Merrill Lynch. Nevertheless, he likes J. P. Morgan Chas=\ne's stock, he said, because ''expectations are very low.''=20\nAll J. P. Morgan Chase's competitors are suffering from the slowdown on Wal=\nl Street. But some, like Citigroup, are better diversified and have greater=\n involvement in old-fashioned consumer banking, which is proving to be a st=\nrong moneymaker this year.=20\nNearly a third of J. P. Morgan Chase's revenues are consumer-oriented. By c=\nontrast, its chief New York rival, Citigroup, gets half its revenues from c=\nonsumer businesses.=20\n''The timing of the merger was bad,'' said Steven Wharton, a banking analys=\nt at Loomis, Sayles & Company, which owns about a million J. P. Morgan Chas=\ne shares. ''There's no disputing that.''=20\nActually, Mr. Harrison disputes it. ''I can't tell you how happy I am about=\n having done this merger,'' he said in a recent interview. ''While there ar=\ne pluses and minuses to operating in a weak economic environment, we have a=\n much stronger platform to manage with during this difficult time.''=20\nIn Mr. Harrison's favor is his battle-tested team of top executives who hav=\ne worked together for a decade or more. Few executives remain in the top sp=\nots from the old J. P. Morgan. Instead, most major posts are filled by mana=\ngers who have worked with Mr. Harrison since his days at Chemical Bank, whe=\nre he spent most of his career. Mr. Harrison's team successfully gobbled up=\n Manufacturers Hanover Bank in 1991, then followed that with Chemical's mer=\nger with Chase Manhattan in 1996 before incorporating Morgan into the fold =\nlast year.=20\nThe group of Chemical veterans includes Marc J. Shapiro, who oversees finan=\nce and risk management at J. P. Morgan Chase; Donald H. Layton, one of two =\nleaders of investment banking; and James B. Lee Jr., the bank's senior deal=\n maker. The team also includes Dina Dublon, the bank's chief financial offi=\ncer.=20\nTwo other senior executives have also lived through big deals. Geoffrey T. =\nBoisi, the other investment banking leader, was the one-time investment ban=\nking chief at Goldman, Sachs. David A. Coulter, in charge of Chase's retail=\n bank, had been chief executive of Bank of America before it was bought by =\nNationsBank.=20\n''There aren't many teams that have gone through as many mergers as Bill Ha=\nrrison and his team,'' said Mark G. Solow, managing principal at GarMark Ad=\nvisors, an investment firm, and a former senior executive at Chemical.=20\nStill, Ms. Dublon acknowledged that the tough economy was making the J. P. =\nMorgan takeover more difficult than the earlier combinations.=20\n''In general, mergers are very hard on morale,'' she said. ''There is no qu=\nestion that this one has a tougher emotional toll.''=20\nThe bank's executives are making the best of a bad situation. They have tak=\nen advantage of the slowdown to cut around 8 percent of the combined banks'=\n staff, or about 2,500 more employees than anticipated at the time the merg=\ner was announced.=20\nMany of these job cuts were aimed at high-cost investment bankers: J. P. Mo=\nrgan Chase expects that 6,000 jobs in its investment banking division will =\nhave been eliminated by the end of the year.=20\n''We have focused on the tougher jobs to cut,'' Ms. Dublon said.=20\nIn some ways the overall market turmoil has made it easier for J. P. Morgan=\n Chase to overhaul its staff. With fewer jobs available on Wall Street, Mr.=\n Shapiro said, the employees who are left behind are less apt to complain a=\nbout changes in their jobs. ''People have fewer options,'' he said, ''so yo=\nu have a little more control over the process.''=20\nThanks partly to these cuts, the bank estimates the saving from cost cuttin=\ng will be $3.6 billion annually, compared with an original projection of $2=\n billion at the time of the merger.=20\nThe cost cutting has helped compensate somewhat for a sharp drop in profits=\n in the bank's core businesses. ''What we can control and are managing very=\n aggressively is the expenses of the company,'' Ms. Dublon said in a confer=\nence call with reporters on Oct. 17, the day earnings were announced.=20\nAside from cost cuts, the weakness on Wall Street makes it hard for the ban=\nk's executives to point to tangible gains in investment banking, where fees=\n were down 24 percent in the third quarter. But Mr. Harrison points to mark=\net-share gains the bank has achieved at the expense of competitors on Wall =\nStreet. He hopes that when the investment banking business revives, J. P. M=\norgan Chase will hold on to these gains.=20\nThe bank is particularly proud of its standing in two areas: mergers and ac=\nquisitions, and the underwriting of large investment-grade bond deals.=20\nThe bank ranked 5th worldwide in the highly profitable category of advising=\n on mergers during the first nine months of 2001, up from Chase's 12th-plac=\ne finish and J. P. Morgan's 10th-place standing during the same period last=\n year, according to Thomson Financial Securities data.=20\nThe merger and acquisitions business, which Chase had been slowly building =\nfor years, is stronger following the merger with J. P. Morgan, said Mr. Lee=\n, a vice chairman at the bank. As a result, the bank is able to win assignm=\nents providing advice to customers who dealt with the old Chase only for lo=\nans.=20\nMr. Lee remains proud of the bank's work with Enron, the energy company, de=\nspite its troubles. J. P. Morgan Chase, along with Citigroup, raised $1 bil=\nlion in bank financing for Enron earlier this month. It was also hired to a=\ndvise the company, which hopes to be saved from collapse by being taken ove=\nr by Dynegy.=20\nThe old Chase, long a lending powerhouse, would have had a good shot at lea=\nding the bank financing, but an advisory role would have been less certain.=\n Mr. Lee said the investment banker advising Enron came from the old J. P. =\nMorgan. But with merger activity slow, there are few such deals to go aroun=\nd.=20\nThe bank is also proud of its strength in long-term investment-grade bonds,=\n another area that business executives say has been enhanced by the merger.=\n It moved up to second place in that area so far this year, compared with s=\nixth place a year ago.=20\nThe bank has taken advantage of a boom in large corporate bond offerings, a=\n surge driven by today's low interest rates. In May J. P. Morgan Chase rais=\ned $12 billion in bonds for WorldCom, the telecommunications company, in th=\ne largest corporate debt deal in the United States on record.=20\nUnfortunately for J. P. Morgan Chase, the fees for underwriting investment-=\ngrade debt are small compared with the money to be earned coordinating offe=\nrings of stock, where J. P. Morgan Chase remains a second-tier competitor.=\n=20\nThe bank actually lost market share in the rankings for underwriters of sto=\nck, falling to 9th place this year, compared with the old J. P. Morgan's 6t=\nh-place finish a year ago. (Chase was 11th.)=20\nMr. Harrison said the bank was taking advantage of the slowdown in stock of=\nferings to build momentum slowly in that business. ''We think we have a cha=\nnce in the second half of this year to be in the top five,'' he said.=20\nGiven the slowdown, some bankers predict that Mr. Harrison will ultimately =\ndo another deal, either to expand his consumer banking business or to bolst=\ner weak areas in investment banking, like the equity division.=20\n''The general view is that the combination with J. P. Morgan didn't do enou=\ngh,'' one investment banker said.=20\nMr. Harrison disagrees: ''I don't feel,'' he said, ''we need to do another =\nlarge deal to be successful.''\n\nPhoto: William B. Harrison Jr., the chief executive, says he has no doubts =\nabout the wisdom of forming J. P. Morgan Chase, even though the the economy=\n has slowed since then. ''I can't tell you how happy I am about having done=\n this merger,'' he said. (Associated Press) Chart: ''Still Looking for the =\nRight Mix'' When J. P. Morgan and Chase announced their merger in September=\n 2000, the combination's strength in investment banking seemed sure to be s=\nuccessful.

That wa=\ns followed by renewed volatility in power prices, and this time the prices =\nwere headed down, not up.=20\nAnd then came a crushing blow against trading firms - the unraveling of the=\n industry's largest player, Enron Corp. (ENE).=20\nSimply put, the perfect storm stalled, and a business once buoyed by high g=\nas prices, strong demand and tight supply now lies in tatters.=20\nThe stocks of companies whom some say should be valued more like growth sto=\ncks than utilities are instead mired at around nine-times earnings - about =\nwhere traditional utilities trade.=20\nAnd the chance for recovery in 2002?=20\nBasu Mullick, portfolio manager of the Neuberger Berman Partners fund, is w=\nilling to bet there is. He thinks energy traders deserve at least the same =\nprice-to-earnings multiple as the broader market's median, which is current=\nly between 16- to 17-times future earnings, he said. It's just a matter of =\ntime before the stocks get there.=20\n\"They were just recovering from Gray Davis,\" Mullick said, referring to the=\n governor of California, who had accused \"out-of-state\" energy traders of a=\nrtificially inflating the price of power in the state, and triggering the s=\ntate's energy crisis. \"Now, they are recovering from Enron.\"=20\nThe fund manager also blames lower commodity prices, warm weather and poor =\ndemand for the recent weak performance in the group.=20\n\"Energy convergence companies are putting up terrific growth rates,\" he sai=\nd. \"I don't think they should get the same valuation as a garden-variety ut=\nility.\"=20\nStill, others think the stock market is continuing to make distinctions bet=\nween the energy traders by taking a harder look at the companies' strategie=\ns and financial disclosures.=20\nEnron's precarious financial situation underscores the importance of accoun=\nting issues. Although many of Enron's financial problems aren't solely the =\nfault of mark-to-market accounting issues, there has been growing attention=\n paid to this form of financial reporting because of the earnings volatilit=\ny it can create.=20\nAnswers Elude Investors=20\n\nInvestors are asking hard questions, and not always getting the answers the=\ny want.=20\nUsing mark-to-market methods, a company calculates the fair market value of=\n a commodity position - whether it's a contract, an option, a swap, etc. - =\nat the time, even if the value of the position is realized over a longer pe=\nriod. The problem with this method is the actual cash a company realizes fr=\nom the position might not be the same value the company calculated in its o=\nriginal assessment. Also, sometimes it isn't easy to calculate the fair val=\nue of the commodity position. This is particularly true in instances where =\nthe market for the commodity isn't liquid.=20\nOver time, companies with the highest level of disclosure regarding their m=\nark-to-market gains will most likely trade at higher multiples to counterpa=\nrts that provide little or no disclosure, said ABN AMRO Inc. analyst Paul P=\natterson.=20\nEncouragingly, it appears companies may already be responding to the call f=\nor added disclosure. According to a survey Patterson conducted, more compan=\nies with energy trading units were willing to disclose the details of their=\n mark-to-market accounting practices during third-quarter conference calls =\ncompared with those in the second quarter.=20\nPatterson said he prefers earnings that are cash-based.=20\n\"All things being equal, we believe reported earnings that more closely ref=\nlect the timely realization of cash have a higher quality associated with t=\nhem than earnings that do not,\" he said.=20\nHe expects investors to become smarter and learn to distinguish between ear=\nnings growth through accrual accounting and growth fueled by mark-to-market=\n accounting.=20\nAt the end of the day, it is not a matter of simply producing profits, but =\nbeing able to say where those earnings came from, said one investor, who ma=\nnages a pension fund.=20\nSome investors also may be placing a greater emphasis on the cash flow the =\nenergy merchants produce.=20\nTim O'Brien, portfolio manager of the Gabelli Utilities Fund, said energy m=\nerchants that own the physical power assets to back up their trading positi=\nons should trade at a premium to an independent power producers and traditi=\nonal utility companies. Still, the stocks should be valued at less than the=\n growth rate of the company because of their heavy exposures to commodity p=\nrices.=20\nEnergy merchants include companies such as Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Duke Energy C=\norp. (DUK) and Dominion Resources Inc. (D).=20\nAccording to O'Brien, the group never deserved to have the price-to-earning=\ns multiples above 20- to 30-times earnings, which were once paid for the st=\nocks.=20\n\"We all got sucked up by the up-leg of the cycle and forgot just how cyclic=\nal these companies are,\" O'Brien said, adding that the average multiple sho=\nuld be in the high single-digits to the high-teens.=20\nAs for independent power producers - which are companies without regulated =\noperations that own power plants to generate electricity to sell and trade =\nin the wholesale market - the group may wind up being valued on the basis o=\nf the replacement costs of the assets in their portfolio, according to O'Br=\nien.=20\n\"One analogy is that they are basically like commercial real-estate plays,\"=\n O'Brien said.=20\nThat could mean stocks such as Calpine Corp. (CPN), which is already in the=\n lower-half of its trading range, may have further to fall.=20\n-By Christina Cheddar, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-5166; christina.cheddar=\n@dowjones.com\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

It is also exploring the idea of alliances with oth=\ner exchanges, and considering developing \"e-mini\" contracts - smaller energ=\ny contracts for Internet-based trade by retail investors.=20\n\"There's new management in place at the exchange,\" said Nymex spokeswoman N=\nachamah Jacobovits. \"They're rethinking all of our business strategies, and=\n one very massive strategy was the idea of this major eNymex B2B (business-=\nto-business) system launch with a whole new slate of products.\"=20\nNymex and GlobalView Software Inc., a company that initially worked on buil=\nding the eNymex trading system, have sued each other in a dispute over work=\n on the project.=20\nKiodex, an electronic-trading technology firm that has developed the back e=\nnd of the eNymex system, took on added development work for the project aft=\ner GlobalView departed. The trade engine Kiodex was asked to build is \"subs=\ntantially complete, but the company can't speak to Nymex's overall electron=\nic-trading strategy,\" a Kiodex source said.=20\nThe eNymex platform was conceived as a forum for trading over-the-counter e=\nnergy products, but Nymex has already moved ahead with plans for trading so=\nme of them on Access, initially an overnight trading system that was expand=\ned in September. It hopes, for example, to launch gas swaps based on delive=\nry at the Henry Hub within the next six weeks on Access, Jacobovits said.=\n=20\n\"We've expedited plans for a Henry Hub natural gas swap contract,\" Jacobovi=\nts said. \"Traders could be looking for OTC clearing on a neutral-based plat=\nform, which is a factor in that decision.\"=20\nBefore Sept. 14, Access was used only to trade energy futures at night, aft=\ner the day's Nymex session had ended. Use was limited to Nymex members with=\n dedicated phone systems.=20\nThe exchange had been planning to expand use of Access, but ended up doing =\nso sooner than it had expected. On Sept. 14, it started offering Access tra=\nding over the Internet, a move that will eventually allow Nymex to open up =\ntrade to more users.=20\nThe move was intended to help keep futures markets liquid after the Sept. 1=\n1 attack on the World Trade Center. Nymex's building, located near where th=\ne trade towers stood, was shut down for several days after the attacks. Exp=\nanding its already existent Access system to the Internet helped ease poten=\ntial liquidity problems that could have arisen from shortened floor trading=\n hours after Nymex reopened.=20\nDevelopment of the eNymex system began last year under the direction of for=\nmer Nymex Chairman Daniel Rappaport. In August, Nymex said it would launch =\nthe eNymex platform within four to eight months. New Nymex President J. Rob=\nert \"Bo\" Collins Jr. said then that vendor problems had slowed development =\nof the system's front-end technology and caused the delays. But he still ex=\npected eNymex to launch without any meaningful changes to its original prod=\nuct line.=20\nIf Nymex combines parts or all of the platform originally intended as eNyme=\nx with Access, the new system may end up being known as eNymex.=20\n\"eNymex right now is looking for a new mission,\" said an industry source cl=\nose to Nymex. \"You know how politics works. We don't scrap it, we just rena=\nme it. Anything we do electronically is now going to be called eNymex. But =\nthe original deal and concept that Rappaport initiated is done.\"=20\nNymex's reconsideration comes as the energy-trading world undergoes rapid c=\nhange. The two most successful online energy trading platforms -- Enron Cor=\np.'s (ENE) EnronOnline, and IntercontinentalExchange, or ICE -- have seen t=\nheir luck turn - in opposite directions.=20\nEnron Corp. (ENE), which accounts for about 25% of the trade in U.S. power =\nand gas markets, faces questions about its creditworthiness as the Securiti=\nes and Exchange Commission investigates complicated financial dealings. Enr=\non's possible merger with Dynegy Inc. (DYN), now appears to be in doubt, an=\nd energy trading companies are pulling back their exposure to the company.=\n=20\nEnron executes about 60% of its power and gas trades on EnronOnline. When E=\nnron's troubles surfaced last month, Nymex quickly moved to extend its clea=\nring services to over-the-counter natural gas derivatives, a move the tradi=\nng community saw as an attempt to grab market share.=20\nICE, on the other hand, is moving ahead with plans to capture more energy t=\nrade on its electronic format. ICE closed a deal this summer to acquire the=\n London-based International Petroleum Exchange - Nymex's chief competitor a=\nnd Europe's largest traditional energy exchange. It plans to move all IPE e=\nnergy contracts to its Internet-based system and offer clearing services fo=\nr some over-the-counter contracts.=20\nNymex is exploring alliances that could give it a better footing in the new=\n competitive landscape. One idea under review is a joint venture with the C=\nhicago Mercantile Exchange to offer e-mini contracts for Nymex products on =\nCME's Globex electronic-trading system, the person close to Nymex said.=20\nNymex officials wouldn't confirm whether they're talking with the CME, but =\nthey said the relationship between the exchanges is a warm one.=20\n\"Nymex is always open to strategic alliances,\" Jacobovits said. \"There's no=\nthing we've agreed to at this point, but we have open dialogue with a numbe=\nr of exchanges concerning strategic alliances. We have a good relationship =\nwith the Chicago Merc, and we certainly would be open to working with them.=\n\"=20\nShortly after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in New York shut down the Nyme=\nx trading floor, the CME said it would be willing to offer Nymex products o=\nn its Globex system until Nymex resumed operations, Jacobovits said.=20\n-By Stephen Parker, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-4426; stephen.parker@dowjo=\nnes.com\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Analysts expect layoffs if the merger occurs.\nContinental announced a layoff of 3,000 employees after the Sept. 11 attack=\ns and Hewlett-Packard Co.'s plan to buy Compaq Computer Corp. will, if fina=\nlized, result in 15,000 layoffs at the two companies.

Next year the city's tax =\nbase is estimated to grow to $95 billion.=20\nStill, the national recession, energy price weakness in general, and the in=\nitial loss of consumer confidence related to the attacks has caused the cit=\ny to reduce its estimate of sales tax growth to 1.5 percent from 5 percent.=\n That revised estimate equals a $13 million reduction in the city's $1.4 bi=\nllion budget.=20\nBut the city's property tax revenue has not been affected.

Du=\nring the past month, Enron has taken a $1 billion write-off of assets, revi=\nsed downward the earnings of the past several years and taken a $1.2 billio=\nn reduction in shareholder equity.\nThe problems have been due largely to dealings Enron had with private partn=\nerships, run by some of its own executives, under investigation by the Secu=\nrities and Exchange Commission. In an SEC filing Monday, Enron disclosed hu=\nndreds of millions of potential additional write-offs as well as the possib=\nility that its weakening financial condition could force it to repay more t=\nhan $2 billion in loans by the end of the year.=20\nAs of 4 p.m. Wednesday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron =\nshares fell $1.98, or 28%, to $5.01 each after having dropped 23% Tuesday. =\nIn excess of 115 million shares traded Wednesday, more than four times the =\nvolume of any other Big Board stock. Enron's bonds also again traded sharpl=\ny lower, market observers said.=20\nThe turmoil spilled over to Dynegy's stock, which also was among the most a=\nctively traded on the New York Stock Exchange. As of 4 p.m. Wednesday, Dyne=\ngy (DYN) shares fell $1.94 to $39.76 each.=20\nOn Wednesday, Dynegy issued a statement in which Chairman and Chief Executi=\nve Chuck Watson said his company was working \"to accelerate the regulatory =\napprovals required to complete the merger in accordance with the previously=\n announced agreement\" though it continued to perform \"due diligence\" on Enr=\non.=20\nUnder the merger agreement, Dynegy has opportunities to renegotiate or walk=\n away from the deal if Enron's financial and legal problems become severe e=\nnough. However, some observers said it can be difficult to invoke these so-=\ncalled material adverse change clauses. They point to a decision earlier th=\nis year by a Delaware Chancery Court judge who forced Tyson Foods Inc. to c=\nomplete a planned purchase of IBP Inc. even though Tyson, a Springdale, Ark=\n., food-products company, had wanted to cancel the transaction because of a=\n drop in IBP's earnings and accounting problems at an IBP unit.=20\nDynegy officials didn't return calls seeking comment. To complete the deal,=\n two-thirds of Dynegy shareholders and a majority of Enron shareholders wou=\nld have to give their approval. No dates for those votes have been set.=20\nOne person familiar with the merger plans said the SEC filing Monday by Enr=\non contained information Dynegy hadn't known about. Dynegy representatives =\nplanned to work through the weekend evaluating the importance of this new i=\nnformation as part of the company's due diligence, this person said. It cou=\nldn't be determined what the new information was.=20\nThe merger agreement, announced Nov. 9, calls for Dynegy to exchange 0.2685=\n share for each of Enron's roughly 850 million fully diluted shares, giving=\n the purchase a value of about $9 billion at Dynegy's current stock price. =\nHowever, from a price standpoint, the deal is appearing less attractive to =\nDynegy.=20\nOn the day of the merger announcement, Enron shares were trading at about $=\n8.63 each, or about 83% of the purchase price under the exchange ratio. As =\nof Wednesday, Enron's market price was only about 47% of the merger-formula=\n price. Such a sharp deterioration is unusual following a merger announceme=\nnt, when the stock price of the company being acquired generally begins tra=\nding relatively close to the offering price.=20\nSentiment among Wall Street analysts also is turning against the merger. In=\nitially, many analysts lauded the merger as a move that would rescue Enron =\nand provide a major boost to Houston-based Dynegy. Dynegy and Enron officia=\nls have predicted that the merger, supposed to be completed late next year,=\n would significantly and immediately increase Dynegy's earnings.=20\nNow analysts are challenging that assumption. Ron Barone, managing director=\n at UBS Warburg LLC, said he believes that because of Enron's financial pro=\nblems, a combined company would actually have lower earnings next year than=\n Dynegy would have by itself. Mr. Barone said he thinks a \"likely scenario\"=\n is that the merger formula will be renegotiated sharply down to about 0.15=\n Dynegy share for each Enron share.=20\nCopyright (c) 2001 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.=20\nAll Rights Reserved.\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The lawsuit w=\nas filed by Portland, Ore., utility lineman Roy Rinard and co-worker Steve =\nLacey.\nEnron shares have plunged more than 90% over the last several months since =\nthe departure of the company's chief executive and an accounting controvers=\ny that prompted the firm to restate its earnings since 1997, eliminating mo=\nre than $580 million of reported income.=20\nSteve Berman, managing partner for the law firm of Hagens Berman in Seattle=\n, said Enron touted the value of its shares and encouraged employees to put=\n their entire portfolio into Enron stock.=20\nEnron officials didn't emphasize the risk and instead painted the situation=\n as positive, especially when the company's stock began to slide, said Berm=\nan, who is hoping to get the suit certified as a class action.=20\nBerman wants to prove that the company's 401(k) plan executives failed to a=\nct responsibly when they knew about serious business problems. He's also ho=\nping to break new legal ground with his case.=20\nThe lawsuit is patterned after a case against Lucent Technologies in which =\nLucent employees sued their employer this summer for matching their 401(k) =\ncontributions with company stock that tanked. That case is still in litigat=\nion.=20\nEarlier this year, Rinard, 54, had $472,000 in his Enron 401(k) plan, which=\n had been growing for 21 years.=20\nToday, his plan is worth about $40,000. Enron gives its employees their 401=\n(k) match in company stock.=20\nIn January, Enron was trading for $84.87. Wednesday it closed at $5.01 a sh=\nare on the New York Stock Exchange.=20\nThe problem was compounded when many employees, including Rinard, saw Enron=\n's stock doing so well that they decided to put their entire account into E=\nnron stock.=20\nEnron executives had talked about how the stock price was poised to climb a=\nbove $100 a share, Rinard told the Houston Chronicle.=20\nIn addition, Enron employees were not allowed to make trades in the 401(k) =\nplan for about a month, starting Oct. 17. That was the day after Enron surp=\nrised the market with the news it was taking a $1.01-billion after-tax thir=\nd-quarter charge to get out of bad investments.=20\nEnron officials, who could not be reached, have said they had planned the l=\nockdown for several months because the company was changing plan administra=\ntors.\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Those same r=\negulators could soon be faced with a similar application from Dynegy as par=\nt of a still-pending deal to acquire cash-strapped Enron.\nIf Enron were to file for bankruptcy before Portland General has been sold,=\n its future could be thrown into the hands of a Texas bankruptcy court, exp=\nerts said.=20\nNorthwest Natural Gas agreed Oct. 8 to acquire Portland General for around =\n$1.8 billion, plus about $1.1 billion in assumed debt and preferred stock. =\nA month later, Enron announced it had agreed to be acquired by Houston-base=\nd Dynegy.=20\n\"We've been watching this from afar to see how it could impact that sale (P=\nortland General's acquisition by Northwest Natural Gas),\" said Roy Hemmingw=\nay, chairman of the Oregon Public Utility Commission.=20\n\"We have authority if that sale doesn't go through to rule on whether Dyneg=\ny can take over Enron,\" he said.=20\nRatings agency Fitch last week cut Portland General's debt ratings due to \"=\nuncertainty at its parent Enron.\" Wednesday, the same agency said a bankrup=\ntcy filing by Enron was \"highly possible\" if the proposed rescue by Dynegy =\ncollapses.=20\n\"We haven't seen any credit problems so far, and Portland General isn't in =\nthe market (buying power for its customers) right now in a big way,\" Hemmin=\ngway said.=20\nHowever, he noted that, \"If they really were unable to conduct their busine=\nss because they were not creditworthy we would have to use whatever instrum=\nents are available\" to make sure service to customers is maintained. Earlie=\nr this year, California was forced to take over buying power for the PG&E u=\nnit of Pacific Gas & Electric and Edison International subsidiary Southern =\nCalifornia Edison after the two utilities saw their credit ratings cut to j=\nunk status.=20\nFederal regulators have insisted the sellers of wholesale power have the ri=\nght to sell to a creditworthy buyer.=20\nCalifornia's largest utility, Pacific Gas & Electric, chose to file for ban=\nkruptcy because of its mounting debt. In a parallel, consumer advocates fea=\nr the fate of the biggest utility in neighboring Oregon could end up in the=\n hands of a bankruptcy judge.=20\nHemmingway said the Oregon Public Utility Commission recently had granted P=\nortland General a rate increase and the utility has \"plenty of cash flow cu=\nrrently to handle its obligations.\"=20\n\"This is nothing like California where that was not the case,\" he said.=20\nNorthwest Natural Gas, which is also based in Portland, has set a target of=\n filing next Wednesday with the Oregon commission to take over the utility,=\n spokesman Steve Sechrist said.=20\n\"We have no concerns whatsoever at this point. The deal is moving forward a=\nnd there is no reason we can see why it should not\" he said, noting the del=\nay to the filing was the result of the complexities of the acquisition.=20\nJason Eisdorfer, a lawyer for the Citizens' Utility Board of Oregon, said m=\najor questions would be raised if Enron went under before the deal were com=\npleted.=20\n\"Would the (bankruptcy) judge let the terms of the agreement go forward.

They fell 45 percent Tuesday and\nWednesday after Enron said it may have to pay more than $9 billion\nin debt due by 2003. Enron 6.4 percent bonds due in July 2006 were\nbid at 55 cents on the dollar, down from 62 cents on Wednesday,\ntraders said.\n\n     Enron shares are trading at less than half the value of\nDynegy's offer, which shows investors are questioning whether the\nbuyout will be completed on the terms agreed to two weeks ago.\nEnron's financial woes may prove to be a drag on Dynegy's earnings\nnext year if the transaction is completed, analysts said.\n\n     ``There are continued doubts about the deal,'' said UBS\nWarburg analyst Ronald Barone, who rates Dynegy a ``strong buy''\nand doesn't own shares in either company. ``Enron's earnings\naren't what they used to be because they've lost trading business.\nGiven that, Dynegy has an opportunity to renegotiate the price.''\n\n     Dynegy spokesman John Sousa said the company ``remains\noptimistic for the potential of the merger.'' Enron agreed Nov. 9\nto the takeover, now valued at about $23 billion in stock and\nassumed debt, after a financial crisis threatened it with\nbankruptcy.\n\n     On Wednesday, Enron got a three-week reprieve from lenders on\na $690 million note due next week, giving the company more time to\nrestructure its finances. Dynegy Chief Executive Officer Chuck\nWatson said he was ``encouraged'' by the commitment to extend the\nnote payment, as well as the closing of a $450 million credit\nfacility, and that Dynegy remained committed to the purchase.\n\n     More than 40 million Enron shares changed hands today, almost\ntwice their three-month daily average, in a session shortened\nbecause of the Thanksgiving holiday. Enron was the most-active\nU.S. stock on Wednesday, with 116 million shares traded. Dynegy\nshares rose 64 cents to $40.40 today.\n\n                       Less Than $2 Billion\n\n     In a Securities & Exchange Commission filing Monday, Enron\nsaid it has less than $2 billion in cash and credit lines left. If\nthe company's cash reserves run too low, Enron is in danger of\nseeing its credit rating cut below investment grade. That would\ntrigger $3.9 billion in debt repayments for two affiliated\npartnerships.\n\n     Enron's bankers have met with unidentified investors,\nincluding leveraged buyout firms and two industrial companies, in\na bid to shore up the energy trader's finances with an injection\nof as much as $2 billion, the New York Times reported yesterday,\nciting unidentified executives close to the companies.\n\n     Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne said the company is seeking\n$500 million to $1 billion. Enron needs to raise $1 billion to\n$1.5 billion in cash within the next 45 days, said Sean Egan,\nmanaging director of Egan-Jones Rating Co.\n\n     ``Their trading operation has burned through cash faster than\nthe market had expected,'' Egan said.\n\n                         Trading Business\n\n     Traders including Mirant Corp. and Aquila Inc. have said they\nshifted transactions away from Enron after its plunging stock\nprice prompted concerns about creditworthiness. Enron has said\nfourth-quarter earnings would be reduced partly by a drop in its\nenergy-trading business.\n\n     Watson said after the Enron buyout was announced he expected\nit to increase 2002 earnings by 35 percent. Analysts said that\ncan't happen unless Enron recovers lost trading business. Several\nhave cut their 2002 estimates for Enron. The average estimate of\nanalysts polled by Thomson Financial/First Call for next year is\nnow $1.68 a share, down from $2.14 a month ago.\n\n     Dynegy can cancel or renegotiate if Enron can't meet debt\npayments, its trading market collapses, banks demand more\ncollateral or raise the interest rate for loans, Enron's credit\nrating is cut to junk, the SEC cites Enron for securities fraud,\nor if Enron's legal liabilities including shareholder suits exceed\n$3.5 billion, Egan said.\n\n\n                     Will Dynegy Renegotiate?\n\n     Dynegy officials were considering whether to try and\nrenegotiate terms of its agreement with Enron, according to the\nNew York Times report. Dynegy and Enron are both based in Houston.\n\n     ``Dynegy investors would like to see the company negotiate a\nlower price for Enron,'' said Credit Lyonnais securities analyst\nGordon Howald, who rates Dynegy ``buy'' and owns no shares.\n\n     Under the Nov. 9 terms, Enron investors would receive 0.2685\nDynegy share for each share held. At today's closing price, that\nvalues Enron stock at $10.85. A year ago, Enron traded at almost\n$80.\n\n     Investors worry that a cancellation of the merger would push\nEnron into bankruptcy.\n\n     ``The market is saying there seems to be no obvious Plan B\nfor Enron and that is what has investors concerned,'' said Eric\nBergson, who helps manage $9 billion of fixed-income assets at\nNorthern Trust Co. in Chicago. ``The lower bond prices go, what\nthe market is saying is that there's less chance of this deal\ngoing through.''\n\n--Jim Polson in Princeton, (609) 750-4658 or jpolson@Bloomberg.net\n\n\nKKR, Blackstone Are Among Likely Enron Investors, Analyst Says\n2001-11-23 16:20 (New York)\n\nKKR, Blackstone Are Among Likely Enron Investors, Analyst Says\n\n     Houston, Nov. 23 (Bloomberg) -- Kohlberg, Kravis Roberts &\nCo., the Blackstone Group and the Carlyle Group are among the\nlikely candidates to be approached by Enron Corp. for a private\nequity investment to shore up the company's balance sheet, said\nindustry analyst David Snow of PrivateEquityCentral.Net.\n\n     The firms have cash on hand and have invested in energy\ncompanies in the past. An investment in Enron may look attractive\nnow that its shares have plunged by 94 percent this year.\n\n     ``Many of the larger, more traditional buyout firms would\nfind this deal attractive,'' said Snow. ``This is a company that\nhas real assets that is down in the dumps and has need of capital\nwhen capital is scarce.''\n\n     Enron's bankers met recently with leveraged buyout firms and\ntwo industrial companies to seek an investment, the New York Times\nreported, citing executives close to the companies. Enron's stock\nfell for a fifth day in six on concern the company's weakened\nfinancial condition may lead Dynegy Inc. to try to cancel or\nrework its planned purchase of the rival Houston company.\n\n     Investors may inject as much as $2 billion under arrangements\nthat would protect them from further declines in Enron's stock,\nthe Times said. The new investments would be in Enron's\nTranswestern Pipeline, which connects natural-gas fields in Texas\nto the California market, the newspaper said.\n\n     J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. agreed to terms\nthat give each of them a $250 million equity stake as part of a\ntransaction to be completed Monday, officials told the newspaper.\n\n     Buyout firms sometimes make collective bids, pooling their\nmoney and distributing the risk. The firms also like to invest in\nindustries that are out of favor with public investors and to do\nso in partnership with corporate investors, like Dynegy, said\nSnow.\n\n     ``You need to know enough about the (energy) business to know\nwhether it's a good deal, and then you need to be confident in the\nDynegy team,'' he said.\n\n                                KKR\n\n     KKR, the second-biggest private equity firm with $24 billion\nin assets, declined comment on Enron through spokeswoman Molly\nMorse of Kekst & Co.\n\n     The New York-based firm invested more than $1.3 billion in\nDPL Inc., a utility in Dayton, Ohio, and will receive $550 million\nof that back from the company after DPL sold $700 million of bonds\nin August.\n\n     ``KKR very much gets involved in deals where there's a\ncorporate partner and they don't have a majority stake,'' Snow\nsaid. ``They would possibly hold it for years, because they like\nslow exits.'' KKR is also a possible candidate because it recently\nraised a new $5 billion buyout fund.\n\n     Any LBO firm would need assurance about how it will get its\nmoney back on an Enron investment, said Snow.\n\n     ``The thing they have to be cautious about is the exit,'' he\nsaid. ``If there's a chance Dynegy would agree to buy out (the LBO\nfirms') stake over time, that would give some confidence. But if\nthe only exit is the public market, that's a little bit dicier.''\n\n     Any private investment also must be large enough to make a\nmeaningful difference: Enron's market value is $3.7 billion and\nDynegy has proposed paying $23 billion in stock and assumption of\ndebt. That means the private equity portion would have to approach\n$1 billion or more.\n\n     The 20 largest private equity firms have assets of more than\n$5 billion under management each, according to Asset Alternatives,\na Wellesley, Massachusetts industry research firm. Still, many of\nthose firms don't have enough free capital to undertake an\ninvestment of $500 million or more.\n\n     An announcement of an investment may come soon, analysts say.\nEnergy trading firms such as Mirant Corp. and Aquila Inc. are\ndoing fewer trades with Enron because of concern that the company\nwon't be able to finance its business. Enron shares have fallen by\nalmost half in the past three sessions.\n\n     ``They're going to need this investment within 30 to 45\ndays,'' said Sean Egan of Egan-Jones Ratings Co. ``They're\nspiraling downward and they're going to need some more beyond the\n$1.5 billion contributed by'' ChevronTexaco Corp., which owns 26\npercent of Dynegy.\n\n                            Other LBOs\n\n     Here's a rundown of the other most likely private equity\npartners for Enron:\n\n     --The Carlyle Group could invest through a $1 billion energy\nfund it's raising, as well as its general U.S. buyout fund, said\nSnow. Carlyle's vice president for corporate communications, Chris\nUllman, declined to comment.\n\n     --Blackstone, which has a history of investing alongside\nother corporate partners, recently closed on a $4 billion buyout\nfund. Blackstone spokesman John Ford declined to comment on\nwhether Enron had approached the firm.\n\n     --Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst, which is based in Texas like\nDynegy and Enron. Hicks Muse counts Triton Energy Ltd., an energy\nexploration company, among its best investments. The firm recently\nraised about $1.5 billion for new investments, about one-third of\nwhat it had hoped to raise, and has said it will focus on ``back-\nto-basics'' investments in food, manufacturing and media. Mark\nSemer, a spokesman for Hicks Muse who also works for Kekst,\ndeclined comment on Enron.\n\n     Spokesmen for two other firms, Warburg Pincus & Co. and\nCredit Suisse First Boston's private equity arm, didn't return\ncalls seeking comment.\n\n--Randy Whitestone in the New York newsroom (212) 940-1805=20\n\nMicrosoft MSN Fast Web Access Expansion Slowed by Enron Suit\n2001-11-23 11:59 (New York)\n\nMicrosoft MSN Fast Web Access Expansion Slowed by Enron Suit\n\n     Redmond, Washington Nov. 23 (Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp.'s\nplans to expand its MSN high-speed Internet service have been\ndelayed by a lawsuit from Enron Corp., which could cost the\ncompany customers during the holiday season, analysts said.\n\n     MSN had planned to have fast Internet access over telephone\nlines available, with help from energy trader Enron, in 45 markets\nstarting Oct. 25. Instead, the service is now on sale in about 30\nmarkets, said MSN Product Manager Lisa Gurry.\n\n     The latest delay follows a string of apparent bad luck that\nhas delayed the rollout of Microsoft's fast Internet access\nservice over the last year. The holidays are typically a popular\ntime for customers to buy so-called broadband access, often along\nwith new personal computers purchased or received as gifts.\n\n     ``They have a track record of picking broadband partners that\ndon't quite work out,'' said Joe Laszlo, senior analyst at market\nresearcher Jupiter Media Metrix Inc. ``It definitely hurts them\nwith customers who want broadband right now.''\n\n     Subscribers to fast Internet access services are expected to\ngrow fourfold by 2006, according to estimates by Jupiter Media\nMetrix, while sales of slower Internet access plans decline. Fast\nInternet service over phone lines uses digital subscriber line, or\nDSL, technology.\n\n                         On Track\n\n     Gurry said Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft is still on\ntrack to have fast access for sale by the end of March to 90\npercent of the 45 million to 50 million households that have DSL\navailable in their neighborhoods.\n\n     ``There is very little growth left in the dial-up access\nspace for Microsoft or anybody, which leaves them with broadband\nas the only potential growth area for the MSN access business,''\nsaid Youssef Squali, an analyst at FAC/Equities, who rates\nMicrosoft Internet competitor AOL Time Warner Inc. a ``buy.''\n\n     Microsoft also wants to deliver consumer services like music\nand video and software updates, which require fast Internet access\nfor smooth downloads.\n\n     The company originally began a service with NorthPoint\nCommunications Group Inc., a now-bankrupt provider of fast Web\naccess. Microsoft has also had difficulty finding partners among\ncable companies who use their networks for high-speed service.\n\n     Now Houston-based Enron, which agreed in June to provide the\nbackbone for a nationwide expansion of MSN's service, is suing.\nEnron claimed in its lawsuit that it isn't required to deliver\nbroadband services if Microsoft hasn't first provided a billing\nand ordering system that the biggest software company agreed to\nbuild.\n\n     Enron, which is being acquired by rival Dynegy Inc., recently\ndisclosed debts of $9.15 billion due by 2003 and restated earnings\nfor four years.\n\n                        Slower Expansion\n\n     MSN has been selling high-speed access in 14 states under\npartnership with Qwest Communications International Inc. for the\nlast few months. MSN has begun the planned service expansion\noutside of those states by working with Enron competitors that MSN\nMarketing Director Bob Visse declined to name. The company is also\ntalking to Enron, he said. Enron didn't return calls for comment.\n\n     Because of the Enron suit the expansion is moving slower than\nexpected, Visse said. Since Oct. 25, MSN has added service in Los\nAngeles, San Francisco, San Diego and Sacramento, California, and\nHouston, Dallas, San Antonio and Austin, Texas, giving Microsoft a\ntotal of about 30 markets rather than 45. Plans to expand\nmarketing are also on hold, Visse said.\n\n     ``It is very unfortunate that we are in the position we are\nin,'' said Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer.\n\n     Top U.S. Internet service provider America Online, owned by\nAOL Time Warner Inc., has also been slow to get into the high-\nspeed market, analysts said.\n\n     That doesn't mean Microsoft is in the clear. Laszlo said both\nMSN and AOL might pay for their sluggishness with tougher\ncompetition from third-place EarthLink Inc. and from cable and\ntelephone companies that have more experience selling high-speed\nInternet access.\n\n     America Online has more than 31 million subscribers to MSN's\n7 million. EarthLink Inc. has 4.77 million subscribers. Laszlo\ndoesn't think MSN or America Online can build the kind of lead in\nthe high-speed market that America Online has in the slower dial-\nup access market.\n\n                       `Not a Permanent Blow'\n\n     Not that anyone need worry about Microsoft. MSN will be able\nto expand its fast Internet access business even with the delays,\nLaszlo said.\n\n     ``They are already late in the broadband market so this means\nthey get a little later,'' he said. ``But broadband will continue\nto grow over the next few years and this is definitely not a\npermanent blow.''\n\n     Analysts also say Microsoft still needs to find a cable\npartner that will let MSN use its network to sell fast access over\ncable lines. Cable is more popular than DSL with customers looking\nfor fast Web service. The five largest cable providers control 51\npercent of the U.S. high-speed Internet market. The five largest\nsellers of access via phone lines and DSL technology account for\nabout 33 percent, according to market researcher ARS Inc.\n\n     Microsoft MSN Vice President Yusuf Mehdi said last month the\ncompany may be interested in an investment in AT&T Corp.'s cable-\ntelevision unit, which AT&T is considering selling. Ballmer\ndeclined to comment on Microsoft's plans.\n\n--Dina Bass in Seattle (206) 521-5981, or dbass2@bloomberg.net\n\n\nMetropolitan Desk; Section A\nCorrections\n\n11/22/2001\nThe New York Times\nPage 2, Column 4\nc. 2001 New York Times Company\n\nBecause of an editing error, an article in World Business yesterday about t=\nhe Enron Corporation's prospects for selling its interest in the Dabhol Pow=\ner project in India misstated the size of its stake.

However, if we are to maintain growth levels, we need to focus very closely on our cost base and create more efficiencies in the current round of Enron Corp. budget reviews.\n\nWe are analysing much more closely exactly which businesses we derive our earnings from and concentrating our resources on those areas.  We will be taking decisions to put some projects on the \"back burner\"and reduce the scope of others.\n\nThis will inevitably mean that we need to reduce our headcount both in commercial and commercial support groups as we seek to identify the best mix of skills to keep us on our earnings growth track.  To this end we will be seeking to cut our headcount in Europe by between five and ten percent, but we will aim as far as possible to achieve this through a program of voluntary severance.  Details of this program will be made available by Monday 8th October.  We hope to complete this exercise and communicate the outcome as quickly as possible in October so that everyone knows where they stand.\n\nPlease feel free to contact either of us, but also talk to your supervisor about any specific concerns you may have and remember that you can also make use of the LifeWorks confidential counselling service that is available on 0800 169 1920.\n\nWe firmly believe that if we work hard together now to achieve these short term goals, we will create a stronger, more flexible team at Enron which will be better placed than ever to grow our business in Europe.\n\nJohn Sherriff and Michael Brown"

There were a few days when I would get in at 7 and power traders in the industry were already trading gas either throught the broker market or on ice.  I'm trying to ensure EOL is the primary system used to trade gas.  However, it is a money loser.  If we gap down 10 cents over a weekend, I lose an average of 5 cents on 600 lots, $300,000, minus bid/offer on maybe 50 buy/sells of 30 lots times .005 is $75,000.  I don't really want to put more automatic products on the system that do little good as far as promoting EOL but are money losers.

Gra=\ny Davis' administration.=20\nThe power traders accuse the Independent System Operator -- which is legall=\ny required to act as an impartial market manager -- of improperly helping s=\ntate power buyers spread out the cost of high- priced electricity contracts=\n.\nEnergy firms as well as municipal utility systems have complained about mys=\nterious charges on their accounts with the grid agency, said Jan Smutney-Jo=\nnes of the Independent Energy Producers Association, which represents such =\nindustry giants as Enron, Dynegy, Williams and Reliant.=20\nThe charges showed up around the time the state Department of Water Resourc=\nes was forced to start selling excess electricity it had purchased at an av=\nerage of $69 per megawatt hour for as little as $1 per megawatt hour.=20\n\"The ISO seems to be following specific instructions the Department of Wate=\nr Resources is giving them,\" Smutney-Jones said.=20\nAn industry source said NRG Energy Inc. and other suppliers were preparing =\na formal complaint to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which could=\n order the state to issue refunds to generators if it finds they have been =\nimproperly charged.=20\nThe commission has ordered an unprecedented operational audit of the grid m=\nanagement agency.=20\nState officials bought power under long-term contracts when it appeared Cal=\nifornia could suffer serious power shortages over the summer. Instead, the =\nstate had more than enough power, and electricity available on the spot mar=\nket suddenly cost half as much as the energy California had bought.=20\nGary Ackerman of the Western Power Trading Forum, an industry group, said t=\nhe grid operator was using a combination of power scheduling and billing pr=\nactices to \"bury\" some of the cost of power purchased by the state in the a=\nccounts of other generators.=20\n\"The state is the biggest buyer and seller of electricity, and they control=\n the governing board of the ISO,\" Ackerman said.=20\nThe governor's spokesman, Steve Maviglio, called the power firms' accusatio=\nns \"absolutely false\" and said the generators were trying to whip up sentim=\nent in Washington to interfere with the state's affairs.=20\n\"The generators know they'll get a much better deal at FERC headquarters in=\n Washington than they will in Sacramento,\" Maviglio said. \"It shouldn't be =\na surprise that they make these accusations here to get federal involvement=\n.\"=20\nOscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the Department of Water Resources, said gene=\nrators could hardly cast themselves as victims in California's energy crisi=\ns.=20\n\"I don't feel sorry for them one bit,\" Hidalgo said. \"They had one heck of =\na year.\"=20\nGregg Fishman, spokesman for the ISO said the agency was preparing a respon=\nse to the accusations.=20\nEnergy trade organizations said they suspected the ISO of using several mec=\nhanisms to charge suppliers for state contract costs.=20\nThe extra expense is sometimes tacked on to suppliers' bills for ISO operat=\ning costs, which all electricity sellers in California share, Ackerman said=\n.=20\nSome firms say they have tried to buy cheap spot market electricity for res=\nale, only to find later that the grid manager has charged them for more exp=\nensive state power. Others say the grid operator orders them to activate st=\nand-by power units on too-short notice. When they can't comply, they say, t=\nhe ISO brings high-priced state power on line and bills them for the extra =\ncost.=20\nThe accusations are part of a struggle for control of California's grid. In=\n January, Davis disbanded the ISO's 26-member governing board, which was ch=\naired by Smutney-Jones, after some critics said it was too cozy with indust=\nry. Davis appointed his own five-member board.=20\nIn February, then-FERC Chairman Curt Hebert said the new board had become \"=\na political arm of the governor.\" The commission is trying to get Californi=\na to turn over its grid to a multistate transmission organization.=20\nDavis has warned Washington to \"keep its hands off\" the ISO.\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

(ENE US)\nwas raised to long-term ``buy'' from long-term ``accumulate'' by analyst\nDonato J. Eassey at Merrill Lynch.  The near-term rating was maintained\n``neutral.''\n\n\nNorthwest to Buy Portland General\nCBS MarketWatch.com\n10/8/2001 7:44:00 PM=20\nPORTLAND, Ore., Oct 08, 2001 (AP Online via COMTEX) -- Northwest Natural Ga=\ns Co. is buying another Oregon utility from Enron Corp. for $1.8 billion, c=\nombining the state's largest natural gas and electric utilities in a merger=\n that may save ratepayers money but could also bring some job losses.\nRichard G. \"Dick\" Reiten, chairman and CEO of Northwest Natural, said Monda=\ny the gas company is buying Portland General Electric Co. after the Houston=\n-based energy giant gave up on its expansion into the Pacific Northwest.\n\"We're extremely pleased that the acquisition will return PGE to local owne=\nrship,\" Reiten said at a news conference.\nBob Jenks, executive director of the Citizens Utility Board, said he was co=\nncerned the combination could encourage Northwest Natural to bypass state r=\negulators by using its business clout to lobby the Legislature and governor=\n's office when rate increases are needed.\n\"If that's going to happen, and PGE rate cases are fought out in the Legisl=\nature and the governor's office, then I don't think that's going to be in t=\nhe interest of PGE customers,\" Jenks said.\nNorthwest Natural was founded in 1859, the year Oregon became a state, usin=\ng gas extracted from coal to light downtown street lamps.\nPGE was founded in 1889 with a hydroelectric generator at Willamette Falls =\nthat anchored the nation's first long-distance electric transmission line w=\nhen it was connected to the city, 14 miles to the north. The plant still op=\nerates, generating 16 megawatts of electricity.\nReiten said the Northwest Natural board of directors has rejected buyout of=\nfers itself in recent years in hopes that an opportunity like the PGE deal =\nwould come along.\n\"It was a conscious choice to remain independent and build assets rather th=\nan sell out of state,\" Reiten said. \"That patience has paid off.\"\nHe said the deal will create a $5 billion utility that can cut costs by com=\nbining repair crews, equipment, service centers and billing in their overla=\npping service area.\nPortland General has about 733,000 customers in northwestern Oregon and Nor=\nthwest Natural has about 530,000 customers in roughly the same area, includ=\ning some in southwestern Washington state. Their headquarters are just a fe=\nw blocks apart on the same downtown street.\nFederal and state regulatory approval, along with shareholder approval, is =\nexpected to take about a year.\nSome job cuts were expected, but Reiten said he hoped most would come throu=\ngh attrition and retirement, rather than layoffs.\nHe said regulators have looked favorably on recent mergers of gas and elect=\nric utilities because they generally have saved money for ratepayers. Combi=\nned utilities already serve about two thirds of the nation, he added.\nEnron purchased PGE in 1997 for about $3.2 billion, including assumption of=\n debt, hoping to tap into energy trading along the entire West Coast, from =\nCalifornia to Washington state. But the Texas company found the pace of der=\negulation in Oregon too slow at a time when the California energy crisis wa=\ns unfolding.\nEnron has a history of buying and selling smaller companies as it searches =\nfor the best position in the constantly shifting energy market, said Mike H=\neim, an A.G. Edwards & Sons analyst who follows the Texas company.\n\"It's really more a strategic move,\" Heim said.\nEnron will receive $1.55 billion cash and $350 million in securities for PG=\nE.\nEnron stock closed at $33.45 on Monday, up $1.72 per share. Northwest Natur=\nal was at $22.99, down 42 cents a share.\n---\n"

Som=\ne of the changes took effect immediately (e.g. additional security personne=\nl) and some are phasing in.  While not all of the changes will be visible, =\nthere are a few that will have an impact on everyday activities.  In all th=\ne steps we take and recommendations we make, we will be making our faciliti=\nes and systems more secure and endeavoring to increase your sense of securi=\nty, while doing our best to minimize disruption to our day-to-day business.\n\nPrimary responsibility for Enron Corp. Security resides in our business con=\ntrols organization.  You can contact this organization through their websit=\ne (<http://home.enron.com/security>), by phone (713-345-2804), or by email =\n(CorporateSecurity@enron.com <mailto:CorporateSecurity@enron.com>).  John B=\nrindle, Senior Director, Business Controls, leads this organization.  Pleas=\ne feel free to provide John and his team with your comments and questions, =\nor to report security threats.\n\nWe have two areas to update you on:  changes in the access procedures for t=\nhe Enron Center Campus in Houston and changes to our travel advisory.\n\nAccess to the Enron Center\n\nOver the next few days, the following access control procedures will be ins=\ntituted at the Enron Center (and other facilities where practical):\n\n?=09As employees swipe their badges at the card readers to enter the Enron =\nCenter, a guard will match the photo on the badge to the bearer.\n\n?=09Employees and contractors who forget their badges must present a valid =\npicture ID to obtain access to the Enron Center (U.S. driver's license, U.S=\n. or foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identif=\nication).=20\n\n?=09Visitors to the Enron Center must produce a valid photo ID when signing=\n in at the lobby reception desk and must completely fill out the visitor ca=\nrd.  Adult visitors without a valid photo ID (U.S. driver's license, U.S. o=\nr foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identifica=\ntion) will not be allowed access to the Enron Center.\n\n?=09Visitors to Enron facilities must be escorted by an Enron employee or b=\nadged contractor at all times.\n\n?=09Visitors to the Enron Center will be met in the lobby by an Enron emplo=\nyee or badged contractor, signed into a visitor's log at the lobby receptio=\nn area by the employee or badged contractor, and escorted to their appointm=\nent.  At the conclusion of the appointment, the visitor will be escorted to=\n the lobby by an employee or badged contractor, the visitor badge collected=\n, and the visitor signed out in the log at the plaza reception area by the =\nescorting employee or badged contractor.\n\n?=09Employees are also being asked to participate in the security of their =\nworkplace by following these guidelines; report suspicious activity to Secu=\nrity (phone 3-6300), do not open secured doors for individuals unknown to y=\nou or hold doors open, allowing \"tail gating\" by others.\n\nThese will be the first in a series of new security procedures to be instit=\nuted at Enron.  We ask that all employees be patient during congested times=\n in the lobby.  As we proceed and obtain increased guard personnel and equi=\npment, we expect the inconvenience to decrease.  We hope you understand the=\nse measures are being instituted for the security of all our employees. =09\n\n\nTravel Advisory Update\n\nWith the beginning of retaliatory strikes, we have two important recommenda=\ntions:\n\n?=09While the retaliatory strikes are ongoing, corporate security recommend=\ns that travel through or to the Middle East be avoided.  We continue to str=\nongly recommend that all travel during this time to Afghanistan, Yemen, Pak=\nistan, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Geo=\nrgia, and the Kyrgyz Republic be canceled.  In addition, we recommend that =\nplanned travel to Egypt, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Ara=\nbia, Syria, and Algeria be very carefully considered.\n\n?=09For non-U.S. citizens traveling in the United States, corporate securit=\ny recommends that you carry documentation.  There have been several recent =\nreports of non-U.S. citizens who reside in the United States being question=\ned and asked for documentation when boarding U.S. domestic flights. As a re=\nsult, we suggest that all non-U.S. citizens who currently reside in the Uni=\nted States - and who do not have Permanent Resident Alien status - carry th=\neir passport, Form I-94 and Form I-797 at all times.  We would also suggest=\n that Permanent Resident Aliens carry their Permanent Resident (Green) Card=\n as proof of their status as a precautionary measure.  It appears that Immi=\ngration Officials may be applying a section of the Immigration and National=\nity Act that requires individuals over the age of 18 to carry his/her \"regi=\nstration\" documentation with them at all times. This can include a Permanen=\nt Resident Card, Form I-94 card, Employment Authorization Card, Border Cros=\nsing Card, or a Temporary Resident Card. Immigration Officials have not his=\ntorically been asking domestic travelers for \"registration\" documentation, =\nbut in light of the heightened security measures and current atmosphere, it=\n would be best to be prepared with all of your documentation proving your c=\nurrent lawful status.\n\nWe will keep you apprised of new information and developments on the Corpor=\nate Security website and by e-mail, as appropriate.\n\n"

I wanted to get this discussion going via written format so that I (or others who may implement this) can stay focused on what you want and not get into broader research, etc....\n\nI think I can put a model together if we can define what parameters, the interface (levers) and model (transfer functions) to use that would be useful for you as phase I product.\n\nI will fire off updates to this document as I make them.  If you have a spec doc or ideas that you want to hand write on a print out, please do so and I will update the document. \n\nI will like to make sure that I am on the same page before beginning to code the program and to start linking to additional moths (month 2, 3, ..) and different curves, etc.\n\nMy Job search has gone well with the Crude desk and I am waiting compensation indication from them to make my decision. Also, Kevin Presto feels that I could potentially help his power group with new market or spread trading.  John Suarez is a director who came from the power desk to EBS is going back to work for Kevin Presto.

The work that Dave Forster did was just for front month.  That creates month 1.  Then, similar logic has to create a month 1/month 2 spread to create a month 2 outright market.   Same for month 2/ month 3 to create month 3.  There might be 24-36 individual markets to create a forward curve.  Sometimes month 1 has correlation to the month 1/ month 2 spread.  Sometimes it does not.  Must create a system that is mechanical but very easy for a human to add bias.  \n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tThuraisingham, Ravi  \nSent:\tMonday, October 01, 2001 10:20 AM\nTo:\tArnold, John\nSubject:\tNeural Networks\n\nJohn, I just wanted to give you heads up that I did look into the subject system to learn from what your trading activities and then figure ways to automate some aspects of you daily activities.

(NYSE: ENE) announced today that it has named Jeff McMahon chief financial officer. McMahon had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron's Industrial Markets group. From 1998 to 2000, McMahon was Enron's treasurer. \n\"Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron,\" said Kenneth L. Lay, Enron chairman and CEO. \"He has the trust and confidence of our investors and financial institutions.\" \nAndrew Fastow, previously Enron's CFO, will be on a leave of absence from the company. \"In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO,\" Lay said. \nMcMahon, 40, joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations. Upon returning to the United States, McMahon was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp. In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works, where he had responsibility for Enron's e-commerce activities. \nMcMahon has a bachelor's degree in business from the University of Richmond in Virginia. He is a Certified Public Accountant, SFA registered and is a member of the American Institute of Public Accountants and Association of Corporate Treasurers. \nEnron is one of the world's leading energy, commodities and services companies. The company markets electricity and natural gas, delivers energy and other physical commodities, and provides financial and risk management services to customers around the world. Enron's Internet address is www.enron.com . The stock is traded under the ticker symbol \"ENE\". \n     Mark Palmer\n     (713) 853-4738\n "

The current recession may have had its origins=\n in the implosion of dot-coms and then other tech stocks, but at least one =\npart of the \"information sector\" may be about to stage a major revival. The=\n entertainment industry-ranging from traditional motion pictures to video g=\names and Internet-based platforms-seems poised to enjoy strong, perhaps eve=\nn explosive, growth over the coming years...The real estate implications fr=\nom these developments may be felt nationally, but most particularly, in a s=\nelect handful of locales...

Inside Real Estate  Cap Rates Edge Higher in Damped CRE Market  Currentl=\ny, two major forces seem to define the opportunities for buyers and sellers=\n in the commercial investment market: Uncertain or falling tenant demand, a=\nnd historically low interest rates and returns on alternative investments. =\nWith these two forces at loggerheads, a wider-than-usual gap has appeared i=\nn the current ask/bid ratio. To get a sense of where cap rates stand, how b=\nrokerage is faring and what prospects lie ahead, Reis's Sam Truitt spoke wi=\nth Harvey E. Green, president and CEO of Marcus & Millichap, which last yea=\nr realized record sales of more than $6 billion in 34 U.S. markets...

Combined with some downgr=\nades in various tech sectors, that is sapping the enthusiasm we saw yesterd=\nay for tech stocks.  Reports of weak earnings and layoffs at Sun Microsyste=\nms from their conference call this morning are adding to the air of gloom a=\nnd doom of today's session.  But foremost on traders' minds today is the un=\nemployment rate announced at 5:30 Eastern Time.  It held steady at 4.9% ins=\ntead of creeping up to 5% as was expected, but that number, does not reflec=\nt the full impact of nearly 200,000 layoffs last month, and analysts feel t=\nhe truth is much worse than the number indicates.  Nonetheless, the indexes=\n are rising, and analysts speculate that this could be due to a growing con=\nfidence among traders that the economy is in good hands and on the road to =\nrecovery.  - - - - - MORE Breaking News  [IMAGE] [IMAGE]    [IMAGE]=09[IMAG=\nE]=09\n\n\n =09    [IMAGE]  Today's Feature - Friday      The Wisdom of Don Carnage  C=\narnage on the real price of petty theft, roller coasters, and self help aut=\nhors, help thyselves!

This is unacceptable.\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Abramo, Caroline \nSent: Sunday, October 07, 2001 11:22 PM\nTo: Lagrasta, Fred\nCc: Dyk, Russell; Zivic, Robyn\nSubject: Back office issues\n\n\n\nFred- \n\nThere are a number of issues we need to address with back office procedures immediately.  We are losing money on avoidable problems and gaining a bad reputation in the market.  Lets get Derek and Michelle together Tuesday afternoon.\n\n2 of our counterparties are writing letters of complaint.. here's a sample of some of the quotes we have heard from the 10 counterparties we have added in the last 6 months.  \n\n\"I shouldn't have to spend my time decomposing the invoices and confirmations you send out\" \n\"It has been 10 days since we traded and we haven't received a shred of paper to give us the details of the trade\" \n\"We are being told in a confirm something different than we are being invoiced for\" \n\"We did not trade 300 contracts per day, it was per month - do you guys even think before you type\" \n\"I am a CFO and an accountant and I can't decipher what you are trying to confirm here\" \n\n\nFrom a business dinner where a client of ours was speaking casually to large industrials and endusers. One, upon the mentioning of B2B exchanges said \"they WILL NOT ever trade on EOL again because the backoffice procedure was such a nightmare.. they couldn't rely on the accuracy or timeliness of the confirm.  This was a captive client who and needs to trade... who will not show us their flow again. \n\nThe latest is the most disturbing:\n\n\"we just want to do a small trade to test your system. We have heard it is a nightmare but want to see for ourselves - I mean how difficult can it be to book the purchase of 50 lots of crude\" And still 5 days later they do not have one paper to show the details, not one phone call to confirm the trade...nothing.  We even warned the BO that this was a new customer and to make best eforts to make sure the process runs smoothly and efficiently. Well, clearly we failed\n\nWe do not understand what is going on in the back office.  Is it that they are too disconnected from our daily operations to understand how integral their accurracy is to our business?  Is there too much turnover? How are they trained?  Who is in charge of the \"backoffice\"?  There seems to be a different manager for every step of the process.. who co-ordinates all their efforts?  Does anyone care?  Ok.. I'll stop.. For our part, we have Michelle coming up to NY for a week in December (we wanted this to happen as soon as she started but did not work for her).\n\nWe have to stop this before we lose clients (which we will).  \n\nAll the problems are being caused by the following:\n\n1. Our inability to generate an accurate position report for our clients.  This has already cost us money this year. Our clients do 10 trades a day.. they are constantly in and out of positions.. it is imperative that we get these right.  As well, this report is our ONLY check to make sure deals are entered and entered correctly into the system.\n\nThere are hundreds of books at Enron.  We have postions on with dozens of them.  We currenttly do not have an automated mechanism to pull deals from every book in one shot.  We have to select books one by one.. this method will always result in books being ommmitted given our deal flow.\n\nMichelle is in charge of this process.  We need a IT person on this yesterday.  Michelle is spending most of her day verifying the validity of the report she generates.  Robyn, Russell, and I check it everyday.. there are always mistakes.\n\n2. There is a breakdown in the backoffice functions after Michelle collects the tickets we write and verbally confirms them.  There is no check after they have been imput.  There are ALWAYS imput errors.  Michelle needs to check every deal after its entered into the system going forward.  \n\nWe also have NO set procedures for the bookings of deals.  We have no idea where our job ends and the book admin's starts.. for non standard deals like gas dailies and swaptions we need to know the exact process from start to finish.\n\n2a. Confirms are sent immediately after deals are entered.. what if deals are imput incorrectly? the confirm goes out anyway resulting in mass confusion at the client.  Going forward, confirms need to be delayed until we can confirm that everything about the deal is correct.\n\n2b. Invoicing.. there have been dozens of occassions where the amounts we are invoicing do not match the deals done.. \n\n3. EOL- We are pushing hard to get counterparties on here.. we have signed Renaissance up (a 10B program fund) but I shudder to see how EOL will fair at these tasks.  \n\n4. Credit- All of our clients are margined.  If deals are in the system incorrectly, the wrong MTM goes to the client.. another mis-match.  We work closely with credit since we need to collect initial margin from some clients.. this amount changes daily- we need someone who can get on the phone with clients and explain these numbers through.. again, we are doing this now.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n "

Emshwiller\nStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal\n\n10/25/2001\nThe Wall Street Journal\nA3\n(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)\n\nEnron Corp. replaced its embattled chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fasto=\nw, capping a tumultuous day in which the huge energy company saw its stock =\nprice again fall sharply and help pull down the share prices of other major=\n energy-trading companies.=20\nInvestors appeared worried that Enron's recent woes could have a destabiliz=\ning effect on the energy-trading market. The Houston energy powerhouse, wit=\nh annualized revenue topping $150 billion and assets of more than $60 billi=\non, handles transactions representing roughly one-quarter of the nation's t=\nraded-electricity and natural-gas volumes. In less than two years of operat=\nion, its EnronOnline trading platform has become a central marketplace for =\nthe energy business and already has handled more than $880 billion in trans=\nactions.\n\"Enron makes the market. Make no mistake about that,\" said Merrill Lynch an=\nalyst Donato Eassey. \"There's not a trader out there that doesn't use Enron=\nOnline.\" As such, Enron enters into thousands of transactions every day in =\nwhich the company's credit-worthiness is critical. Enron said its business =\noperations were functioning normally yesterday. The company also has consis=\ntently said it is financially strong and liquid.=20\nEnron said its new chief financial officer is Jeffrey McMahon, the 40-year-=\nold head of the company's industrial-markets division. His selection may be=\n intended, in part, to raise the company's credibility. People familiar wit=\nh the matter say Mr. McMahon left his job as treasurer last year after voic=\ning concerns within the company about Mr. Fastow's role in running two limi=\nted partnerships that were involved in billions of dollars worth of transac=\ntions with Enron. Internal partnership documents indicate Mr. Fastow and po=\nssibly a handful of associates made millions of dollars from the partnershi=\nps. Mr. Fastow severed his ties with those partnerships in July in the face=\n of increasing conflict-of-interest concerns being expressed by Wall Street=\n analysts and major Enron investors. On Monday, Enron announced that the Se=\ncurities and Exchange Commission was looking into the Fastow-related transa=\nctions.=20\nWhile Enron as recently as Tuesday strongly defended Mr. Fastow, as well as=\n the company's dealings with the partnerships, controversy over those arran=\ngements clearly played a role in the executive's departure. \"In my continue=\nd discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that rest=\noring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO,\" said Ch=\nairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay in a prepared statement.=20\nEnron said Mr. Fastow \"will be on a leave of absence from the company.\" He =\ncouldn't be reached for comment.=20\nIt remains to be seen how much Mr. Fastow's removal will assuage an increas=\ningly restive investment community. The action came after the 4 p.m. market=\n close and followed a day in which Enron's stock once again plunged. As of =\n4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron shares were at $=\n16.41, down $3.38, or 17%. It topped the Big Board's most active list at ne=\narly 76 million shares, more than twice the volume of the second-most-activ=\ne stock. Several trades yesterday involved blocks of 800,000 shares or more=\n, possibly indicating that some institutional holders are souring on Enron =\nstock.=20\nEnron's shares are down about 50% from the beginning of last week. Earlier =\nthis year, the stock was above $80 a share.=20\nIn an apparent ripple effect, the stocks of other energy-trading companies,=\n which do business with Enron, also fell sharply yesterday. For instance, D=\nynegy Inc. shares on the Big Board were off $5.45, or 13%, at $37.26. A num=\nber of the energy companies hit by the selloff have business strategies muc=\nh different than Enron's, which rely heavily on complex and highly structur=\ned investment vehicles.=20\nPrudential Securities analyst Carol Coale said Mr. Fastow's departure could=\n be seen as evidence that \"management does care\" about investor concerns. H=\nowever, she adds, the move also could be viewed by some investors, coming a=\ns it did two days after the announcement of the SEC inquiry, as \"an admissi=\non of guilt.\" Ms. Coale yesterday issued a sell recommendation on Enron lar=\ngely because of uncertainties about the company's extremely complex financi=\nal structure.=20\nEnron has consistently denied any wrongdoing in its Fastow-related dealings=\n.=20\nWorries and rumors about Enron's financial strength could be found in the s=\ntock market yesterday. Goldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer said he heard =\npeople voice concerns about a possible \"death spiral\" in which increasing c=\nredit concerns about Enron would decrease the number of people willing to d=\no business with the company, which would in turn weaken its finances and le=\nad to further business reductions. Mr. Fleischer, a longtime fan who still =\nhas a buy recommendation on the company, said he hasn't yet seen any eviden=\nce of such a problem.=20\nHowever, Mr. Fleischer said, Enron needs to disclose more information about=\n its myriad of financial transactions with related partnerships and other e=\nntities. Enron is facing a problem with \"trust and credibility. It's not ea=\nsy to regain something as basic as trust,\" he said.\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Looks at Dealings\nBy FLOYD NORRIS\n\n10/25/2001\nThe New York Times\nPage 2, Column 5\nc. 2001 New York Times Company\n\nThe Enron Corporation, its stock battered by a sudden loss of investor conf=\nidence, yesterday ousted its chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, who=\nse involvement in complicated transactions with Enron has drawn the scrutin=\ny of the Securities and Exchange Commission.=20\n''In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear=\n to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy =\nas C.F.O.,'' Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's chairman and chief executive, said in =\na statement announcing the change. Only one day before, Mr. Lay had told in=\nvestors in a conference call that he and the Enron board ''continue to have=\n the highest faith and confidence in Andy.''\nThe company said that Mr. Fastow had taken a leave of absence, but it also =\nnamed his successor, Jeffrey McMahon, the head of Enron's industrial market=\ns group and a former corporate treasurer.=20\nEnron said none of the officials were available for interviews last night.=\n=20\nThe move came after the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, wh=\nere Enron's shares fell $3.38, to $16.41. The price has been cut in half si=\nnce Oct. 16, when Enron reported its third-quarter earnings. A $1.2 billion=\n reduction in shareholder equity brought on by ending some relationships wi=\nth partnerships that Mr. Fastow had headed was not disclosed in the earning=\ns news release. Mr. Lay briefly mentioned it in the conference call that fo=\nllowed, but some analysts thought he was referring to a separate $1 billion=\n write-off that was disclosed in the earnings document, and were angered wh=\nen they later learned about it.=20\nOn Tuesday, when both Mr. Fastow and Mr. Lay discussed the company with ana=\nlysts on the conference call, neither was willing to discuss details of the=\n transactions between Enron and the partnerships formerly controlled by Mr.=\n Fastow. Mr. Lay cited the S.E.C. inquiry in declining to discuss the detai=\nls of the transactions.=20\nThe fact the transactions took place has been known for a year, but Enron's=\n disclosures have been widely criticized for being impossible to understand=\n.=20\nBy structuring the deals as involving forward commitments to deliver Enron =\nstock, it appears that Enron was able to assure that losses on them would n=\not lead to reported losses, but instead to reductions of shareholder equity=\n that had no effect on the income statement. That is one of the issues the =\nS.E.C., whose inquiries were disclosed Monday by the company, is expected t=\no address.=20\nConcerns have also grown this week over whether Enron will face losses from=\n complicated financing strategies that kept billions of dollars of debts of=\nf its balance sheet but left the company responsible for paying -- either i=\nn cash or with stock -- if things went wrong. On Tuesday, Mr. Fastow assure=\nd investors that the company ''expects to continue to have sufficient liqui=\ndity to meet normal obligations,'' and said it had bank credit lines that w=\nere more than adequate.=20\nMr. Fastow was viewed as one of the architects, with Jeffrey K. Skilling, t=\nhe former Enron chief executive who resigned in August, of the change in bu=\nsiness strategy that turned Enron from a gas-pipeline company into a an ene=\nrgy trading powerhouse that developed a large Wall Street following. Its st=\nock price peaked in the summer of 2000 at $90.75.=20\nAccording to a person close to the company, while Mr. McMahon, Mr. Fastow's=\n successor, was Enron's treasurer, he told Mr. Skilling, who at the time wa=\ns the chief operating officer, that he thought the partnerships involving M=\nr. Fastow presented a conflict of interest. After that discussion, Mr. McMa=\nhon moved to a different job at the company, this person said.=20\nShares of Enron traded as low as $15.51 yesterday afternoon, the lowest pri=\nce for the stock since early 1995, before recovering. In after-hours tradin=\ng, they fell to $16.14.=20\nOne of the factors that hurt the stock yesterday was a decision by M. Carol=\n Coale, an analyst at Prudential Securities, to drop her rating to ''sell''=\n from ''hold.'' She had lowered the rating to ''hold'' from ''buy'' on Mond=\nay.=20\n''After the S.E.C. inquiry was announced,'' she said in an interview yester=\nday evening, ''Enron should have addressed it by delivering a scapegoat, as=\n a gesture to the Street. Now they are replacing him today. The timing is a=\n little late, but I think it will be received positively by the Street.''=\n=20\nBut she said that investor sentiment might work the other way. ''People cou=\nld fear that if you remove Fastow from the management team, you'll never ge=\nt any answers.''\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The com=\npany said the move was not a reflection on Fastow or a belief that he had d=\none anything improper.=20\n\"In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear =\nto me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy a=\ns CFO,\" Enron Chairman and CEO Ken Lay said in a statement after the stock =\nmarket closed on a day investors continued dumping shares.=20\nEnron, which had seen its stock battered this year for a variety of reasons=\n, found itself high on Wall Street's hit list after it released third-quart=\ner earnings on Oct 16.=20\nThe earnings report drew renewed attention to something investors and analy=\nsts had already expressed displeasure at: Fastow, with the approval of Enro=\nn's board, had formed and run two investment partnerships -- LJM Cayman and=\n LJM2 Co-Investment.=20\nThe partnerships, which did complex financing and hedging deals with Enron,=\n served as a source of funding for Enron projects and investments.=20\nBut Wall Street questioned how Fastow could watch out for the interests of =\nEnron's shareholders and the investment partnership at the same time.=20\nSo Fastow, in June, resigned his roles at the partnerships and Enron also e=\nnded its relationships with the LJM entities. During the third-quarter, Enr=\non took a $35 million loss related to ending its LJM ties as well as a $1.2=\n billion reduction in shareholder equity.=20\nTuesday, Lay told analysts and investors that procedures were rigorously fo=\nllowed to ensure the interests of Enron and its shareholders were protected=\n in dealings with the LJM partnerships. He said a \"Chinese wall\" existed be=\ntween Enron and LJM.=20\nFastow's replacement, McMahon, previously served as Enron's treasurer befor=\ne moving last year to another job with Enron. Most recently, he headed up t=\nhe company's industrial markets group. A source close to Enron said McMahon=\n asked to be reassigned from the treasurer's job because he was uncomfortab=\nle with the Fastow-LJM setup.=20\nEnron spokesman Mark Palmer said neither Fastow nor McMahon was available f=\nor comment Wednesday. He also didn't know whether Fastow is still receiving=\n a salary.=20\nEnron disclosed on Monday that federal securities regulators had begun an \"=\ninformal inquiry\" into the LJM dealings.=20\nThe news proved terrible for a company already working to rebuild investor =\nconfidence after a series of failed investments in telecommunications, wate=\nr and retail power businesses and the surprise resignation of CEO Jeff Skil=\nling in August for personal reasons.=20\nA continuously growing number of shareholder lawsuits against Enron followe=\nd the earnings report and the news of the SEC inquiry.=20\nWall Street has stepped up its chronic complaints that Enron's various fina=\nncial dealings are too complex to follow and that the company fails to give=\n analysts enough data to make proper evaluations.=20\nBeyond the LJM partnerships, investors are concerned about two other partne=\nrships Enron set up. Among the worries is that Enron will end up having to =\nissue new shares of stock to cover commitments associated with those entiti=\nes.=20\nInvestors wouldn't like that because it would dilute the value of current o=\nutstanding shares. They are also afraid that Enron's debt credit rating may=\n be downgraded, which could have negative impacts on its overall business.=\n=20\nIn the last six days, Enron's shares have closed lower and lower. On Oct. 1=\n6, the stock closed at $33.84. On Wednesday it closed at $16.41, down $3.38=\n.=20\nWednesday, the hubbub surrounding Enron also dragged down shares in other c=\nompanies that engage in energy trading, including Houston-based Dynegy, whi=\nch closed down $5.45 at $37.26. There is concern Enron's woes could in some=\n way end up harming the energy trading markets.=20\nA conference call Lay and senior executives, including Fastow, held with an=\nalysts Tuesday to help clear up questions didn't go as Enron hoped.=20\nOn Wednesday, Carol Coale, an analyst with Prudential Securities in Houston=\n, moved from a \"hold\" to a \"sell\" rating.=20\n\nFRONT PAGE - FIRST SECTION - Enron replaces finance chief.\nBy JULIE EARLE and SHEILA MCNULTY.\n\n10/25/2001\nFinancial Times (U.K. edition)\n(c) 2001 Financial Times Limited .

The move came a day after Mr =\nLay defended Mr Fastow amid questions about his ties to controversial partn=\nerships that had forced Enron to take a $1.2bn write-off.=20\nThat loss, revealed last week, sparked the share sell-off amid concerns the=\nre may be more bad news to come. Enron disclosed the loss during an October=\n 16 conference call with analysts on its third-quarter results, saying the =\ncharge stemmed from closing funding mechanisms that Enron had set up in the=\n partnerships established with Mr Fastow.=20\nAnalysts say the charge has not been satisfactorily explained, leading to c=\nonfusion among investors and an unofficial inquiry by the Securities and Ex=\nchange Commission.=20\n\"In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear =\nto me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy a=\ns CFO,\" Mr Lay said. He said Jeff McMahon, chairman and chief executive of =\nEnron's industrial markets group, would replace Mr Fastow. Mr McMahon earli=\ner served as Enron's treasurer.=20\nAnalysts said it was unclear whether Mr Fastow's departure would be enough.=\n Carol Coale, of Prudential Securities, said the move was positive in demon=\nstrating that Enron was being sensitive to Wall Street, which had called fo=\nr Mr Fastow to be replaced. Yet, she added, it came three days after those =\ncalls.=20\nMs Coale issued a \"sell\" recommendation on Enron earlier yesterday, leading=\n to a drop of almost 18 per cent in its share price. \"We are concerned abou=\nt what we don't know,\" Ms Coale said. She was concerned that Enron might ha=\nve to sell assets below book value to maintain its credit rating, or be for=\nced to issue equity to bolster its balance sheet.

As details of this dea=\nl, and others, have emerged over the past two weeks, Enron stock has collap=\nsed, falling 54% in just seven days.=20\nWednesday, the stock fell a further 17% on enormous volume, signifying that=\n once-faithful mutual fund holders were bailing. Also Wednesday, a raft of =\nonce-friendly analysts downgraded the stock. Faced with betrayal on that sc=\nale, Enron management at last felt compelled to act; a press release says F=\nastow is taking a leave of absence. He's been replaced by Jeffrey McMahon, =\nformerly CEO of Enron's industrial markets group.=20\nHow might the Enron bulls spin this? Likely, they will point to McMahon's a=\nlleged opposition to Fastow's role in the big hedging deal, called LJM2, to=\n show that the \"Fastow era\" is over. The Wall Street Journal, citing anonym=\nous sources, reported Tuesday that as treasurer at Enron McMahon complained=\n about Fastow's possible conflict of interest. Probably, the fear was that =\nFastow couldn't serve Enron and LJM2 equally, especially as he was allegedl=\ny making a lot of money from LJM2.=20\nClearly, if McMahon turns out to be a new broom, that's a positive for Enro=\nn. An Enron spokeswoman declined to comment on whether The Journal's accoun=\nt of McMahon's stance on LJM2 was correct.=20\nNot much else is encouraging, however. Fastow's departure shows that it too=\nk massive drops in Enron stock to force senior management into action. On a=\n difficult conference call Tuesday, CEO Ken Lay gave Fastow resounding back=\ning. It took Wednesday's plunge to get Lay to sign off on a new CFO. In oth=\ner words, Lay listens only when the market screams and hollers. How much fu=\nrther does the stock have to fall to bring further much-needed reforms at t=\nhe company?=20\nThe spokeswoman responds that Lay had discussions with analysts Tuesday and=\n Wednesday that led him to the conclusion that Fastow's replacement was nec=\nessary to rebuild investor confidence.=20\nEnron culture is thick with financial sorcery. People got upset by one shad=\nowy deal, but no one knows exactly how the company's core energy trading bu=\nsiness makes money. It's hard to believe the LJM2 deals were done in isolat=\nion and without the knowledge of the board.=20\nIn fact, the chatter is that Fastow and former CEO Jeff Skilling proposed t=\nhe LJM2 transactions to the board after it was reluctant to enter the broad=\nband business. The board apparently feared the volatility that might come f=\nrom being in broadband, so Fastow allegedly proposed LJM2 as a way to hedge=\n that volatility away. This meant LJM2 entered agreements that gave it acce=\nss to increases in the value of broadband assets but protected Enron from t=\nhe downside. Should the whole board be on the hook, too? The spokeswoman re=\nsponds that the board would not have entered the LJM2 transaction if it had=\n not thought it would benefit Enron and its shareholders.=20\nLay has shown himself to be woefully out of touch with the market's views. =\nArguably, that's downright reckless for a trading company that is dependent=\n on potentially skittish short-term financing. Letting things get this bad =\nhas risked good faith among Enron counterparties and bankers. It shows an u=\nnhealthy reluctance to address key problems until they're unavoidable. The =\nspokeswoman responds that the company is now working hard to improve transp=\narency.=20\nAny efforts in that direction will be much appreciated, but is it any wonde=\nr people compare this lot to Long Term Capital Management?=20\n\n\nPhew!

The paper this week said Skilling saw no problem with it=\n, which led McMahon, 40, to ask for a job change. ?Fastow has denied any wr=\nongdoing, but has been limited in his ability to speak about the issues bec=\nause of the SEC investigation and shareholder lawsuits now pending against =\nthe company. ?As recently as a year ago, Enron had a stellar image as a cor=\nporate innovator with a Midas touch. Its profits and stock price soared as =\nit transformed from a natural gas pipeline company to a high-tech money mac=\nhine creating new Internet-based trading markets in a wide range of commodi=\nties. ?But some of its new businesses faded, a large investment in an India=\nn power plant went sour, the California power crises spooked investors, and=\n then Skilling stunned the financial community with his sudden resignation.=\n ?There also was grousing from investors that Enron's earnings statements h=\nad become convoluted to the point of incomprehensibility. ?Analysts said th=\ne replacement of Fastow was a step in the right direction for Enron, but no=\nt a panacea for its credibility problems. ?\"The problems investors are havi=\nng with Enron are related to a lack of understanding of all these partnersh=\nip arrangements. Changing the CFO by itself doesn't really address those co=\nncerns,\" said Mike Heim at A.G. Edwards. ?\"I don't think anyone has a full =\nunderstanding of the extent of the liabilities Enron might have with these =\npartnerships,\" he said. \"I still have a lot of questions.\" ?Andre Meade at =\nCommerzbank Securities said Fastow's departure was not unexpected, but not =\nthat helpful. ?\"Investors are not going to see this as a huge move that cle=\nars up the picture,\" he said. \"Frankly, Ken Lay and the board don't have cl=\nean hands when it comes to these transactions.\" ?\"The fear driving the mark=\net is: if this is what we know, how much worse can it get?\" said J.P.

Rebuffed, McMahon secured a reassignment, the?J=\nournal said, citing people familiar with the matter.??     ``McMahon was ma=\nde famous under Skilling by going to him and?objecting to the partnerships,=\n'' Feygin said. ``For that, he was?transferred out of the treasurer functio=\nn into Enron Net Works,''?which oversees Enron's Internet trading system.??=\n                       `An Outstanding Job'??     Fastow, 39 years old, ran=\n LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-Investment,?two partnerships created by Enron to bu=\ny company assets. Enron's?involvement in the financing vehicles cost the co=\nmpany $35 million?in third-quarter losses. Enron also bought back 62 millio=\nn shares?from LJM2 at a cost of $1.2 billion to unwind its investment.??   =\n  On a conference call yesterday, Lay said that ``I and Enron's?board of di=\nrectors continue to have the highest faith and?confidence in Andy and think=\n he's doing an outstanding job as?CFO.''??      Enron announced that Fastow=\n would leave after its stock?closed down $3.38, or 17 percent, to $16.41 in=\n today's trading.??      The SEC began an inquiry into Enron's partnerships=\n Monday.?Spokeswoman Karen Denne said it is an informal inquiry that Enron?=\nis cooperating with, and that no subpoenas have been received.??     The co=\nmpany has formed at least 18 affiliated partnerships?and corporations, some=\n of which buy and sell Enron assets such as?power plants, records at the Te=\nxas secretary of state's office?indicate.??     The Texas records list doze=\nns of Enron executives as officers?and directors of company-related partner=\nships. None of them have?any financial interest in the partnerships after F=\nastow severed?ties to the LJM partnerships in July, Palmer said.??         =\n               `Zero Compensation'??     ``The managers in these affiliates=\n listed as managing members?are representational in nature only,'' he said.=\n ``They get zero?compensation.''??     The LJM partnerships were different.=\n Enron's board allowed?Fastow, who has worked for the company for 11 years,=\n to run them?and earn as much as 2 percent annually on the amounts invested=\n,?the Wall Street Journal reported last week. A lawsuit filed by a?sharehol=\nder objecting to the arrangement said the partnerships?reworked an agreemen=\nt with Enron to avoid taking big losses.??     Enron is obligated to repay =\n$3.3 billion associated with two?other partnerships, Marlin and Whitewing, =\nif they can't raise?enough money from asset sales to pay off the balance, E=\nnron?spokesman Mark Palmer said. Palmer said ``maybe, maybe not'' when?aske=\nd if the partnerships will generate enough cash.??     ``The concern now is=\nn't just with the LJM partnership, it's?more with the other partnerships, s=\nuch as Osprey and Marlin,''?said A.G. Edwards analyst Mike Heim, who has a =\n``hold'' rating on?Enron and owns no shares.??                       High L=\nevel Departures??     Enron has lost several senior executives in the past =\ntwo?years. CEO Skilling resigned in August after seven months on the?job, c=\niting personal reasons and frustration with declines in the?company's stock=\n price. Enron Corp. Vice Chairman Joseph W. Sutton?left the company in Nove=\nmber as the company switched its focus?from developing assets to energy and=\n commodity trading.??     Rebecca Mark, one of the highest-ranking women in=\n U.S.?business, quit August 2000 as chairman and chief executive of?Azurix =\nCorp., a water company formed by Enron Corp. Mark also?resigned from Enron'=\ns board.??     Azurix was a money-losing investment. Enron sold shares in?t=\nhe water company to the public that it later had to buy back.??--Russell Hu=\nbbard in the Princeton newsroom at 609-750-4651??"

Individuals are responsible for paying their own fees.  Financial support from Enron is at manager's discretion and is subject to the usual tuition reimbursement constraints around budget and relevance to organizational performance.\n\n\nHOW TO ENROLL:\n\t1.  Print out the attached registration form.\n\t2.  Complete the form, but please note the following \n\t\tSPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS:\n\t\tA.  Fill out the student information completely, including\n\t\t\tyour email address.\n\t\tB.  In the Enrollment section, where it says \"Please enroll\n\t\t\tme in GMAT Class Size-8 Course # _________\", \n\t\t\tplease indicate either course #7129-00 (Tuesdays) or # 7129-01 (Thursdays).  \nIf you wish, you may indicate one course as your first choice and the other as your second choice.\n\t\tC.

Indeed, in many cases, it is the single most decisive statistic\nthat admissions offices use in evaluating applicants.  While work\nexperience, GPA, essays, and interviews are all important components of your\napplication, the GMAT is the one objective factor that you can substantially\nimprove in a short period of time.\n\nTHE TEXAS MBA TOUR:\n\tAll interested Enron employees are invited to attend the Texas MBA\nTour, which will be in Houston on Wednesday, January 23. The Texas MBA Tour,\nof which The Princeton Review is a partner, is a group of six business\nschools that host a joint MBA panel discussion and admissions fair.  The\nparticipating schools are Texas, Rice, SMU, Baylor, TCU, and Texas A&M.  The\nPrinceton Review has agreed to handle registration for the event, so call\n(800) 2REVIEW to register.\n\nhttp://home.enron.com:84/messaging/gmatregform.pdf"

                "Content": " JARNOLD (Non-Privileged).pst\n\nGood Morning! \nBottom line: No Changes - Overall US conditions will return to a more normal late fall/early winter pattern (no Arctic air) over the next 2 days. This pattern will persist through the end of the month. \nFor the near term (1-5): Bottom Line - Cooler weather will bring temperatures below normal from the beginning through the middle of the week in the Midwest and from the middle through the end of the week in the East and South. The below normal event will last 3 to 4 days before normal temperatures return. The Rockies and West will be normal to above normal with cooling by the end of the week.\nDetails: We see some cool anomalies arriving into the Midwest tomorrow, with temperatures in Chicago reaching highs late tonight and the mercury falling through the day tomorrow. By Tuesday, the South and Texas will be in the below normal category, with Dallas overnights in the mid-30s (normal low 43), Houston's low 40s (normal upper-40s) and Chicago will freeze, with a mid-20 overnight. Progressing into the Northeast by wednesday, Philly and New York will get into the below normal category, but 5 or 6 degree anomalies are most likely. Looks like a three day event as it moves easterly and then is followed by moderation.\n6-10 Day Bottom Line: Variable conditions continue with a stormy pattern entrenched over much of the nation. Overall temperatures will be normal to cool with very wet conditions. NO strong Arctic air is expected.\nDetails: A strong storm will push into the West late next week and next weekend bringing heavy rain and snow and temperatures near to below normal. At the same time - the Midwest will warm toward normal with wet conditions developing. By early in the last week of November the strong western storm will push into the central U.S. bringing widespread rain and snow. Behind the system another surge of below normal temperatures will track from the Midwest to the South to the East.\n11-15 Day a generally cool and wet weather pattern will persist over much of the nation. While NO Arctic air is clear on the horizon - temperatures on a national average will be cooler than normal and there will be an increased threat for rain and snow. \nSo, with normals dropping across the nation, this first cool air anomaly event arriving in the Midwest by Tuesday will elevate the nation's gas demand requirements into the 60 Bcf/d plus regime from here on through the winter. Here's the strip beginning with today:\nSun \t11/18 \t47 Bcfd \nMon \t11/19 \t54 Bcfd \nTue \t11/20 \t67 Bcfd \nWed \t11/21 \t69 Bcfd \nThu \t11/22 \t65 Bcfd \nFri \t11/23 \t62 Bcfd \nSat \t11/24 \t61 Bcfd \nSun \t11/25 \t62 Bcfd \nMon \t11/26 \t64 Bcfd \nTue \t11/27 \t63 Bcfd \nTill tomorrow, \nThe Weather Team "

It's a wa=\niting game with traders anxious to see some big earnings news tonight as IB=\nM and Intel are scheduled to report in after the close.  Till then, traders=\n seem to be a bit wary after weeks of gains and nothing really positive in =\nterms of trading impetus.  There were neither major earnings shocks today n=\nor lowering of guidance, and that alone is enough to apply some upward pres=\nsure on the heels of yesterday's late surge.  It doesn't take much to creat=\ne a sense of optimism, as any shred of good news is expected to bring the b=\nuyers out after analysts have predicted this to be the worst earnings seaso=\nn in a decade.  Wall Street may be looking ahead to quarters to come, as we=\nll, and there is a sense that the economy is on the road to recovery.  Anal=\nysts feel that over the next two quarters economic weakness will be dissipa=\nting, and there will be a rebound in earnings by the second quarter of 2002=\n.  It may be a choppy road ahead, however, as Wall Street continues to feel=\n the pressure of a growing anthrax scare and the ongoing military action in=\n Afghanistan.  - - - - - MORE Breaking News  [IMAGE] [IMAGE]    [IMAGE]=09[=\nIMAGE]=09\n\n\n =09    [IMAGE]  Today's Feature - Tuesday    [IMAGE] Wanna know what exper=\nts are saying about the most important stocks...yours?

We have worked with Chris Gaskill to get the morning briefing that he puts together for you and your traders and find it very helpful.\n \nHowever, I am interested in going a step further and would like to talk with you or one of your traders on a regular basis in order to get a more trading-centric view on this morning packet.  Specifically, I want to ask the question, \"What do you view as most important in this information\" so we can develop our own \"value added\" information for Gary's group.\n \nIs there one of your traders who I might be able to meet with (after market close, of course) to discuss?\n \nThanks, John.\n \nJeff"

It's a strange situation - the Universities own the bldg and land but a Trust pays the bills.  He says that \"the facility isn't anywhere near the campus.\"\n\nThe PG&E account number is ZNL8242005.

On October 2nd, the Commission staff released a white paper on market-based rate issues.  The Commission has also discussed the issue at recent meetings, but it was struck from the last Commission agenda and is not listed on the agenda for the October 24th Commission meeting.\n\nBased on our conversations, attached is a draft leave-behind addressing market-based rate authorization and FERC's recently released staff report outlining several alternatives to the currently used hub-and-spoke method.  The draft puts the issue of market-based rate authority into the bigger context of both the Commission's goals of creating workably competitive markets and the array of tools available to deal with market power abuses.  We criticize the proposed supply margin assessment approach, but are less clear on what alternative we would prefer if hub-and-spoke is no longer viable.\n\nWe have scheduled a conference call on Friday, October 26th at 11:00 a.m. (EDT) to discuss the draft leave-behind and our strategy for moving forward on this issue.  We have to very clear on what message we want to leave with the Commissioners and FERC staff.  Are we recommending a less rigorous test for market-based rate authority with market mitigation and intervention after the fact?  Under what circumstances is market mitigation appropriate and how should it be done?  If the hub-and-spoke methodology is flawed, is it worth leaving it in place to get maximum market entry?  Are there alternative tests that better meet the Commission (and our) goals?\n\nIf you have any questions or comments before the call, please contact Erin Perrigo at 202-628-8200 or eperrigo@epsa.org.\n\nAttachment\n\n\n - MBR Leave Behind.doc "

Rick Shapiro and Jim Steffes were present on the call.\n\nJohn Anderson's purpose for the call with Jeff was to find out what Enron wanted to see in legislation in order for Enron to give deference to NERC to become a Self-Regulated Organization for setting reliability standards.\n\nJeff explained that the PJM version has a more likeable approach than the NERC version, PJM's is less prescriptive and relies more on FERC participation in establishing a \"SRO\".  Additionally, funding concerns are not addressed in either version and a viable funding mechanism that does not rely on Regional Councils is needed.\n\nJeff also would like to make a presentation (as soon as possible) to the NERC Board of Trustees of the key items Enron would like to see resolved that would provide Enron enough confidence that the NERC/NAERO organization would be independent enough from the stakeholders and be willing enough to tackle the industry's toughest issues concerning competitive markets in electricity.  \n\nI will be working with the Enron-NERC team on a breifing paper of what we want NERC to fix in current NERC rules and processes for NERC to demonstrate it is worthy of the \"SRO\" status.  Some example issues include:\n1) Indpendence requirements for operators and Security Coordinators\n2) competitive advantages of control areas - parking and hubbing\n3) competitive advantages of native and network service - source and sink data requirements\n\nCharles Yeung\n713-853-0348"

I do not know who Gordon is nor his connections with the rest of the ESC group so I cannot gage the effect of your proposed e-mail to him. This is what I know:\n\nThe BOT wanted some immediate action, the NERC staff was under pressure (criticism) at the meeting. The inclusion of the ESC mention was an attempt to latch-on to some positive development. NERC wanted to be linked with it and not be left out, (where this effort may be re-directed to EISB for continuation)  Some stakeholders smelled a rat, and wanted to link NERC's link to this effort to a new committee voting structure; therefore  items 7, 8, and 9 were modified to reflect these comments,  and this is how the resolution came out below (see below).\n\nThe next step will be at FERC to decide how the OASIS 2 work is to continue and under whose leadership. It may not be under the existing ESC group or a reformulation of it. \n\nNext week (Tuesday)  I would like to review all the interconnected issues so that we provide guidance to ESPA\n\nJose\n\t\n\n\nResolution on the Role of NERC in Developing Market Interface or Commercial Practice Standards \n(Board Agenda Item 20)\n\nWHEREAS, Reliability standards developed by NERC, relying on the expertise of industry experts, have been the basis for the reliable operation of the bulk electric systems in North America for over 30 years; and\n\nWHEREAS, With the opening of the transmission systems, the vertical disaggregating of the former monopoly utilities, and the introduction of marketers and independent power producers, NERC has moved proactively to make its standards process more fair, open, balanced and inclusive; and\n\nWHEREAS, To support the evolution of competitive electricity markets, the formation of large RTOs, and continued reliability and security of interconnected transmission grids, it is vitally important to standardize and make mandatory both reliability standards and wholesale electric business practice standards; and\n\nWHEREAS, NERC has taken a number of proactive steps to deal with the linkages between reliability standards and wholesale electric business practice standards, including spearheading the OASIS \"What\" and \"How\" working groups that developed the Standards and Communications Protocols followed by all transmission providers; formed a Market Interface Committee as a new standing committee of NERC to address the impact of reliability standards on markets and the impact of market practices on reliability; and initiated the formation of and facilitates the Electronic Scheduling Collaborative (ESC), which recently filed with FERC a report on their efforts to develop common business practice standards for electronic scheduling (OASIS Phase 2); and \n\nWHEREAS, the electric business practice standards being developed by the Electronic Scheduling Collaborative (ESC) are a complement to the new NERC Reliability Model on which NERC's future Organization Standards will be based; and \n\nWHEREAS, NERC is recognized and respected as the industry's developer of standards for the reliable planning and operation of interconnected transmission grids throughout North America, and\n\nWHEREAS, the Board of Trustees recognizes the urgent need for uniform wholesale electric business practice standards that are well coordinated with reliability standards; and\n\nWHEREAS, the NERC Stakeholders Committee has expressed a strong preference for a single organization to develop both reliability standards and wholesale electric business practice standards;\n\nBE IT THEREFORE RESOLVED, that NERC:\n\n1.\tTake all necessary steps to become the single organization in North America to develop both reliability standards and wholesale electric business practice standards through a fair, open, balanced, and inclusive process, and to file such standards with FERC and appropriate government agencies in Canada.\n\n2.\tActively solicit cooperation, collaboration, and support from Canadian and U.S. government entities to establish NERC as the single organization in North America for the development of reliability standards and wholesale electric business practice standards.\n\n3.\tTake immediate action to adopt and implement the six Initial Recommendations of the Standing Committee Representation Task Force contained in Board Agenda Item 22.\n\n4.\tFacilitate - jointly with interested trade associations; federal, state, and provincial regulators; and other stakeholder organizations - an open and inclusive process to achieve consensus on the definitions and attributes of the functions necessary for the development of wholesale electric industry standards and practices, and on a course of action to institute such capabilities.\n\n5.\tInterface with state and provincial regulators to address retail operational issues that may affect wholesale electric operations.\n\n6.\tBuild on the results of activities to date regarding the new Reliability Model and new Organization Standards Development Process.\n\n7.\tRecommend that FERC use the ESC report, which has already been submitted to FERC, as the basis for a notice of proposed rulemaking on electric business practice standards.\n\n8.\tUrge FERC to make use of the ESC, which will use the new sector weighted voting model approved by the NERC Board, for further development of wholesale electric business practice standards, including standards necessary for certain aspects of RTO design such as congestion management and ancillary services.\n\n9.\tCommit to continuing to support the work of the ESC until such time as an industry consensus is achieved on how to develop wholesale electric business practice standards within the NERC framework.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom:\tAndy Rodriquez/ENRON@enronXgate on 10/17/2001 11:31 PM\nTo:\tCharles Yeung/ENRON@enronXgate, Jose Bestard/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Darla Steffes/ENRON@enronXgate, Richard Shapiro/ENRON@enronXgate\ncc:\t \n\nSubject:\tRE: BOT Support for the ESC and Sector Voting\n\nCharles, Jose, Jim, and Rick, \n\nI would like to send the letter below out to the ESC.  Before I do so, do you have any objections?  I would like to put some fire under this issue, as the \"new sector weighted voting model\" seems to be yet another way to preserve the power of the traditional utility.  However, I don't know if we will compromise any of our other positions by stirring this particular pot.  Thoughts?\n\nAndy\n\n\n\nGordon,\n\nWhen did the ESC vote to adopt the  \"new sector weighted voting model?\"  Has the ESC been absorbed into NERC, and is the NERC Board ordering them to use this new model?  If so, is the ESC a new standing committee?  Do they report directly to the board? Just where would the ESC fit in NERC?\n\nUnless the ESC votes to change their charter to say they are a group under NERCs control, I don't see how this can move forward as written.  The ESC has never been a NERC group, but instead a industry collaborative which NERC has assisted with administrative matters (facilitation, meeting schedules, etc...).  If I recall correctly, there was a significant number of people that specifically did not _want_ the ESC to be a NERC group, (APPA, ELCON, EPSA, and a few others, if I remember correctly).  This was why the NERC ESTF became the non-NERC ESC.  I expect several entities will have comments to make before just handing the keys to NERC.  \n\nOf course, those comments may have already been made at the Board, and may have been addressed there.  But I seriously don't think NERC can just \"annex\" the ESC without the ESC voting to be annexed.  \n\nOther members of the ESC - do you share this concern?\n\nAndy Rodriquez\nRegulatory Affairs - Enron Corp.\nandy.rodriquez@enron.com\n713-345-3771 \n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Gordon Scott [mailto:Gordon.Scott@nerc.net]\nSent: Wednesday, October 17, 2001 9:55 AM\nTo: Electronic Scheduling Task Force\nSubject: BOT Support for the ESC and Sector Voting\nImportance: High\n\n\nDear ESC,\n\nAttached are two documents from the recent NERC BOT meeting: 1.

This will prevent NERC from trying to splinter EPSA members on the EISB vs NERC issue,  and claim that Enron has endorsed NERC as the SSO. We need to make clear to NERC they are not the only sandbox we will be playing in to form an SSO.  We need to safeguard our ability to keep feet on both sides of the fence.\n\nThe strategy I have been pursuing for the past 6 months has been one of keeping competition out there for SSO status.  Our support of EISB has resulted in some good changes at NERC as seen last week.  Of course we are nowhere near finished.  We need to keep the competition going between NERC and EISB now more than ever since it is likely that without competition, NERC will spinmeister all its actions as broad-based consensus and sell that to FERC and the Hill.  \n\nMy new focus is to maintain support for an EISB formation that is open and inclusive so that NERC will be challenged to demonstrate its reformation process (possibly through a Blue Ribbon Panel?) is as open and inclusive as EISB's.  EPSA plans to take up DOE's offer to sponsor a forum to form the 4th quadrant of EISB and we should participate in that forum.  If NERC cannot tout its process is as open and inclusive as any other, they will lose the fight.\n\n\n"

He called me to check the Enron concerns about the ESC resolutions as expressed by Andy Rodriquez' email.\n\nDave reverted to the fact that the sector voting model was language added at the request of John Anderson and Vann Prater.  I explained to him that those words were needed as an add on to salvage what we could.  If NERC was going to adopt the resolutions 7-9 concerning the ESC, John's concern (and I agree with him) was that the ESC structure doesn't work.  I think you agree as well given the response to the joint TCCG request to Gent last year re: membership on the ESC.  The intent of the additional language was to make the best of a bad situation.  If the ESC was going to be roped into NERC, it should at least adopt the new voting structure.  \n\nThis may be useful info. for you.\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \t\"Mark Bennett\" <MBennett@epsa.org>@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS  \nSent:\tFriday, October 26, 2001 11:49 AM\nTo:\tYeung, Charles\nSubject:\tRe: FW: Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking-Standardizing Generator Interconnection Agreements and Procedures\n\nCharles--Thanks for this.  On the NERC front, it is becoming increasingly important to know  exactly what, if any, discussion the Stakeholders Committee engaged in specifically relating to the ESC.  John Anderson told me that the first draft of the Resolution on NERC's role on market interface/commercial practices did NOT contain points 7-9 addressing the ESC.  According to John, those provisions were added overnight by Nevius and company.\n\nIt is important to know whether, and how, the Stakeholders Committee discussed the ESC, particularly whether their was consensus on the ESC issue.  Julie and Lynne are meeting with Pat Wood on Tuesday to discuss general matters and may have an opportunity to briefly address this an NERC/EISB stuff.  It would be good for them to point out to Wood that, contrary to Gent's letter, the Stakeholder Committee was in fact not wholely supportive of all aspects of the Resolution.

Slade Gorton (R-WA), was approved by the Senate in the last Congress.  The House of Representatives did not act on the bill.  S. 2071 represents the only consensus bill to be approved by either chamber.\n\nThis legislation would establish a national electric reliability organization (ERO) with the authority to establish and enforce mandatory reliability standards.\n\nFERC would have primary jurisdiction over:\n\n? the electric reliability organization (ERO);\n\n? all Affiliated Regional Reliability Entities (entities to which authority would\n  be delegated to enforce compliance with reliability standards);\n\n? all system operators; and\n\n? all users of the bulk-power system.\n\nThe bill prescribes procedural guidelines for FERC approval of applications competing for status as the ERO and ERO standards. It would also require all users of the transmission system to comply with such standards.\n\nWhat causes us some concern are a number of provisions in the legislation that would delegate authority to different entities.  The bill would:\n\n? Allow the ERO, subject to FERC approval, to delegate authority to a\n  requesting regional entity to implement and enforce compliance with\n  standards.\n\n? Include a broad savings clause which preserves state authority to \"ensure\n  the safety, adequacy and reliability of electric service within each state.\"\n\n? Not ensure that the boundaries of ARREs and RTOs are the same,\n  although it would instruct ARREs to cooperate with RTOs to ensure\n  enforcement of standards.\n\nA similar bill - H.R. 2602 - was introduced in the House last session by Rep. Albert Wynn (D-MD). No action was taken on this bill.  The same language is included in the comprehensive energy bill introduced by Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee Chairman Jeff Bingaman (D-NM).\n\nOther Developments\n\nLast year, in response to failed attempts by the Congress to pass comprehensive electricity legislation, a number of groups headed by NERC, sent a letter to House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert (R-IL), calling for the passage of stand alone reliability legislation.  The letter is attached.  A number of groups, including public power groups, the California ISO, Edison Electric Institute, NARUC and the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association all signed the letter.\n\nEPSA was strongly pressured to sign the letter to add more weight and credibility to the effort.  However, we did not sign the letter.  While we stated that we did not oppose the letter, EPSA's position at the time was the advocacy for comprehensive federal legislation.\n\nLast month, a number of groups with interests in reliability legislation met in Washington in an attempt to forge an agreement on legislation that can be supported by industry stakeholders.  Efforts were made to shorten the existing legislation similar to the bill introduced by Rep. Albert Wynn without changing the intent of provisions in the language.  In addition to EPSA, other groups in attendance included NARUC, the Pennsylvania PUC, Entergy, PJM , Public Power Groups, Consumer Groups, ELCON, Mirant and Enron.  The meeting produced a realization among the participants on the wide difference of opinions on how best to proceed.  The state PUCs lobbied for a continued state role in reliability language.  Entergy supported the original language contained in the Bingaman bill.  Still, a number of other groups favored the shorter PJM version.\n\nPJM Proposal\n\nPJM recently circulated condensed reliability language.  The 4-page bill would give enforcement authority to FERC.  If you would like a copy faxed to you, please contact Michael Reddy (mreddy@epsa.org) at EPSA.  Additionally, FERC would establish reliability standards and will maintain primary jurisdiction.  FERC would designate a national reliability entity composed of a number of regional entities for the purpose of developing reliability standards for the transmission system.\n\nSome concerns over the PJM language include:\n\n? Formation of regional entities that would be a \"bottoms up\" organization.\n  These entities would have no regard to how they conform with RTOs.\n\n? Reliability standards would be developed as voluntary consensus\n  standards\n\n? The regions and the national entity would be on equal ground.\n\nRevised NERC language\n\nJust last Thursday NERC convened another meeting for the purposes of attempting to shorten the original NERC language.  Working off of the language found in the Wynn bill, the new language was shortened to 16 pages.  The red-lined version is attached.  Among the noteworthy changes:\n\n? p. 6, applications for approval to become the ERO, strikes language to\n  specify funding mechanisms and requirements.\n\n? p. 13, changes in filings of funding and funding procedures, language\n  deleted on specifics on changes to funding.\n\n? p. 21, additional language added to state that neither the ERO nor FERC\n  will have the authority to order construction of additional generation or\n  transmission if it determines a need.\n\n? p. 22, language on coordination with RTOs deleted.\n\nStatus and Prospects of Legislation\n\nThe Republican House and the leadership of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, chaired by Rep. W.J. \"Billy\" Tauzin (R-LA) and Subcommittee on Energy and Air Quality Chairman Joe Barton (R-TX) has maintained the position that electricity should be addressed in a comprehensive fashion.  This is a continuation of the position held by Former House Commerce Chairman Tom Bliley (R-VA).   Staff for Chairman Tauzin are in the process of developing electricity provisions during the August recess.  It is likely that one of the titles will be on reliability.\n\nThe Senate, with its recent switch in control, remains uncertain on the overall view of stand alone reliability legislation.  In its present version, Senate Energy Chairman Bingaman's bill contains the same reliability provisions found in the Wynn bill.  Chairman Bingaman also plans to markup legislation in the Fall.\n\nRegulatory/NERC/GISB Developments\n\nWhile the timing and details of reliability legislation remain uncertain, NERC has continued its effort to transition to NAERO.  When first envisioned several years ago, the legislative objective was to establish NAERO as a self-regulatory organization with authority to enforce mandatory reliability standards.  Legislative delays, however, led the NERC Board to take unilateral steps to advance the transition, beginning with its governance structure.\n\nLast February, the 38 member board was replaced by a new board of ten independent board members.  Members of the former board then were reconstituted as the new Stakeholder Committee with an advisory role, in addition to authority to participate in funding, board member changes and a few other general matters.  Also, the board implemented a compliance program based upon contracts to be executed by the Regional Reliability Councils.  Funding for NERC, presently administered by the regions, remains an extremely problematic, open question, as is the continued dominance of transmission providers in the current NERC Standing Committee voting structure.\n\nThe GISB proposal to include a wholesale electric quadrant in the new Energy Industry Standards Board (EISB) has provided an alternative that didn't exist at the time the NAERO concept, and related legislative effort, began.  The EISB model, which would combine the development of gas and electric retail and wholesale standards, initially viewed as a remote prospect when it was floated in early 2000, has gained substantial momentum.\n\nDuring FERC's June 19th technical conference on Function 8 and interregional coordination, the Commissioners compared the circumstances in the gas industry that led to the formation of GISB with those of the electric industry today.  In separate letters to GISB Executive Director Rae McQuade dated August 13th, Commissioners Massey, Wood and Brownell observed the need to develop uniform rules and standards and expressed enthusiastic support for a new EISB to do it.  Those letters were distributed during an industry conference hosted by the Department of Energy (DOE) on August 14 - 15th, further contributing to the credibility of the EISB proposal.\n\nMeanwhile, the pressure that the EISB proposal is generating clearly appears to have become part of the overall context for NERC's reform effort, as well as the reliability legislation.  A task force set up by the NERC Stakeholder Committee is reviewing how to make the three Standing Committees more \"open and inclusive,\" including possible recommendations to change the voting structure from the current 50/50 (transmission provider/transmission customer) to a sector approach.  The NERC board may receive those recommendations, and other possible NERC reforms, including a new Organization Standards Process, when it meets in October.\n\nThe effort to launch an EISB is expected to come to a head when the GISB board meets on September 19th.  There are indications that the board will approve going forward with the proposal.  Such action would considerably raise the stakes for the NERC board, and present challenging issues regarding how to set up the voting sectors within the wholesale electric quadrant.\n\nAdditionally, the industry will need to consider how to more precisely define the types of standards the new organization would develop.  The emergence of a new EISB, if it occurs, could potentially diverge from legislation that presumes that NERC/NAERO will be the only standard setting organization.  Granting a new NAERO authority over \"reliability\" will beg serious questions regarding its scope of activities, and create the specter of multiple organizations that many hope to avoid. \n - Hastert Letter Final 091200 - Attachments_1.doc \n - Hastert Letter Final 0912002_1.doc \n - Wynn Bill with Red Line Changes - 080901_1.DOC "

So, would CAEM be effective or needed on the RTO front=\n?  Also in Steve Walton's opinion, much more ATC and TTC is left off the ta=\nble than what these technologies may be able to offer, so you can get more =\nbang for the buck by pushing for better NERC rules, curbing regional counci=\nl authority, getting more FERC action, etc.  CAEM technologies could become=\n a crutch for a bad-boy utility to not doing what is right in the first pla=\nce.

This effort should be especially timely in light of =\nthe concern over the extent to which the current changes in the regulatory =\nframework are really being created to address problems resulting from the c=\nrazy-quilt legacy transmission system, and may tend to institutionalize som=\ne aspects of those legacy systems.      =20\n=20\nThe Center is proposing to bring together a blue-ribbon panel to evaluate o=\npportunities for enhancing the nation's electric transmission grid through =\nthe use of various new technologies, including in particular solid-state po=\nwer electronics-based solutions (\"FACTS\" technologies), high voltage direct=\n current (\"HVDC\")  interconnectors across \"seams\" in the regional grids, an=\nd superconducting-based technologies.  The Grid Enhancement Evaluation Proj=\nect is the only effort of its kind to bring together a diverse group of sen=\nior executives to undertake the following:  1) Agree upon the appropriate m=\nethodology; 2) Using the methodology, authorize a panel of experts to indep=\nendently evaluate the technologies on their state of development and curren=\nt commercial viability; 3) Make policy recommendations on what changes may =\nbe required to integrate these new technologies into the existing regulator=\ny framework and eliminate identified barriers to commercial deployment; and=\n 4) Conduct an educational campaign to raise public awareness and acceptanc=\ne of these technologies. =20\n\nThe project will begin in the Fall of 2001 and a Final Report will be issue=\nd January 2002.  The project is expected to have a significant impact on de=\ncisions made by regulators, financial analysts, utility executives, the med=\nia and potential customers.   Consistent with the Center's usual practice, =\nthe Project will include public are as well as private sector participants,=\n and will culminate in a public report.=20\n\n\nWe would welcome your participation Steve, or the appropriate Enron designa=\nte to this effort.

Fundamentally, there are still major differences.  NERC continues to push for the embodiment of deference by FERC to the \"SRO\" in the legislation.  \n\nGiven the conference call last week with John Q Anderson, Dave Cook and Jeff Skilling, we were concerned how the upcoming meeting on Aug 9 by NERC stakeholders to \"finalize\" the NERC version would impact Jeff's request to speak with the Independent Board members before accepting any form of deference to NERC to become the SRO (or the term we prefer Standards Setting Organization - SSO).\n\nThe meeting on the 9th should not interfere with Jeff's ability to present issues to the Board.  We don't think Jeff needs to contact John Q Anderson or any NERC members about the Aug 9 meeting.  However, for the discussions with NERC, John Shelk plans to \"stay the line\" on the Enron position of keeping authority to defer to any SSO with FERC and to keep any language that defers to the SSO out of the legislation.  \n\nJeff should still be able to argue for key Board action items, and if Enron is appeased, deference to NERC could still be given - but not through legislation, rather through FERC \"comfort\" that the SSO is doing a good job.  By knowing that FERC can \"pull the plug\" on the SSO if it is not satisfied, this will provide the correct incentive for the SSO to ensure that no industry segment dominates the standards setting process.\n\nI am completing a draft of issues that we want the Independents to resolve/address for Jeff Skilling to take to the Board.\nAdditionally, Andy Rodriquez and I will develop a summary of examples of why NERC, in its current form, is not able to develop consensus rules that all its members are willing to comply with.  These examples should be powerful arguments for John Shelk to leverage in arguments for FERC authority in the legislation.  \n\nWe also discussed the need to shop our reliability legislation principles with Pat Wood and perhaps DOE.\n\nCharles Yeung\n713-853-0348\n\n"

It will decide who uses the system, how it will be used, what schedu=\nles will be accepted, etc.  Do we really want it to set the standards by it=\ns performance is to be judged by others?  There are two tendencies to guard=\n against.  (1)  Most of these organizations are going to be not-for-profit =\nISOs in form.  There may be a tendency to use very stringent rules to minim=\nize outage risk and criticism of the RTO's management.  This could require =\nthe construction of facilities when they are not completly necessary.  (2) =\nThe opposite possiblity exists, namely, that they will adjust rules to cove=\nr their own mistakes.  I think the former problem is the most likely. =20\n\nIf the RTOs take over the NERC role as suggested, then the reliability rule=\ns would have to become part of the FERC tariff.  In order to judge the vali=\ndity of the \"reliability provisions\" of the tariffs the FERC will be requir=\ned to develop expertise it does not have.  In practice NERC doesn't have th=\ne expertise either.  It really resides in the members of the committees and=\n is thus derived from the industry.  By having a separate Standards Setting=\n Organization, the rules can still be established using the expertise of th=\ne industry.  The SSO would propose rules which FERC would accept subject to=\n complaint.  The SSO's governance has to be fair, but I am not personally c=\noncerned about it being indepenent as long as FERC has oversight. It is the=\n service provider (the RTO) that needs to be independent.  The standards in=\n most industries are set in this way.  The power of the state to enforce th=\ne rules come from commissions of various types.  For instance, the National=\n Electric Code is developed by the industry, but its enforcement is accompl=\nished by adopting it into building codes, state liscensing requirements, et=\nc.  In the same way, the SSO can develop the reliability rules which are in=\ncorporated in FERC's requirement imposed on the RTO.  The RTO's tariff woul=\nd incorporate them by reference.  If the RTOs performance violates the rule=\ns or if a generator doesn't hold up its requirements, then ADR/FERC action =\ncan be taken to enforce.\n\nMy reason for this long message is to draw attention to the fact that the m=\najor function of the RTO is provision of transmission service.  It should n=\not see itself as a regulator.  The case of the CAISO is instructive, since =\nthey think they are above compliance with rules since the believe they are =\nthe guardians of the public interest.  When the service provider thinks it =\nregulates to comes to believe it has a right to decide who \"should\" have tr=\nansmission service rather than get on with providing it.=20\n\nSteve\n\n=09 -----Original Message-----\n=09From: =09Perrino, Dave =20\n=09Sent:=09Tuesday, August 07, 2001 6:16 PM\n=09To:=09Yeung, Charles; Shapiro, Richard; Steffes, James D.\n=09Cc:=09Shelk, John; Rodriquez, Andy; Ingersoll, Richard; Novosel, Sarah; =\nNicolay, Christi L.; Scott, Susan; Walton, Steve\n=09Subject:=09FTC / NERC - Comment of the Staff of the Bureau of Economics =\nand of Policy Planning of the Federal Trade Commission.\n\nCharles,\n\n=09Attached to this message is the results of a study completed by the FTC =\nat DOE's request relating to NERC and open access, dated Jan 4, 2001.

Today's control area is required under NERC policy to meet many reliability requirements for short-term, daily and real-time operations.   NERC CACTF identified 4 major areas of function:\n\n1) Security Authority \nPerforms short term security analysis for interchange schedules (between control areas)\nAdministers curtailment procedures (NERC TLR)\n\n2) Interchange Authority\nResponsible for maintaining a net of interchange schedules that balance at control area interfaces in real-time\n\n3) Balancing Authority\nProvides real-time dispatch to match energy demand and supply\nMaintains performance measures such as frequency, and voltage requirements\nMaintains accounting balance sheets for inadvertent energy between control areas\n\n4) Transmission Service Provider\nOffers transmission access through a tariff\nCalculates ATC/TTC and other transfer capability amounts\nResponsible for accounting line losses\n\n5) Market Participants\nIncludes Purchasing Selling Entities, Generators, and Load Serving Entities\n\nIt is important to remember that the NERC CACTF Relibility Model describes only FUNCTIONs and does not attempt to restructure a vertically integrated control area that may perform any and all of these functions.\n\nThe CACTF developed these concepts and explored how to provide comparability and eliminate competitive advantages of control areas.  This entailed specifiying indpendence requirements on certain functions.  Unfortunately, in order to eliminate the competitive advantages, transmission companies (particularly SERC members and small municipalities) successfully argued that NERC lacked the authority to order or mandate restructuring of organizations to accomodate the CACTF model and its independence requirements.  \n\nIt is Enron's position at NERC that the Security Authority, Transmission Service Provider, and the Balancing Authoirity must be divorced of the market participants - i.e. - \"independence\".  Today, Enron and other entities have obtained certain control area advantages through formation of control areas to specifically obtain the abilities provided under the Interchange Authority.  It was the attempt of the CACTF to unbundle the control area such that all market participants had comparable access to the Interchange Authority advantages.\n\nThe Grid South problem:\nTheir current proposal is to have the RTO perform the Interchange Authority function.  For tags (PTP service) that are submitted that utilize the Grid South tariff, GridSouth will approve and clear those tags for scheduling.  However, the 3 existing control areas would continue to perform the control area functions for its own transactions and native load schedules (inadvertent accounting, balancing, and performance criteria CPS, remains in the control areas).  In other words, the proposal only delegates the bare minimum of control area functions to the GridSouth operator, those needed to administer the tariff for PTP service customers.  Except for the Secuirty Authority functions which will be performed by GridSouth, the operational advantages of control areas, will remain at the transmission company level. \n\nFERC must mandate the independence requirements and  force GridSouth members to restructure to remove all competitive advantages.\n\nCharles Yeung\n713-853-0348\npager 1-800-605-8249\n\n"

Salvosa, Manager of Government Affairs\n\nDATE: August 31, 2001\n\nRE: August 20th Joint Legislative/Regulatory Affairs Meeting\n      on Reliability Legislation\n      -Summary of EPSA Position\n      -Exploration of Future Initiatives\n\nThe August 20th Meeting\n\nOn August 20th, the EPSA's Legislative and Regulatory Affairs Committees met to review and discuss existing proposals on reliability legislation.  Dave Nevius of NERC explained the current draft of the so-called stakeholder \"consensus\" bill, and Bobby Lamb presented the competing proposal being advanced by PJM.  After these presentations, Nevius and Lamb responded to numerous questions.  Thereafter, EPSA members discussed the relative merits of the two proposals, concluding with a straw poll indicating support for exploring an alternative to NERC's bill.\n\nSpecifically, EPSA members expressed general dissatisfaction with the new, \"streamlined\" version of the NERC bill.  Additionally, serious doubts exist regarding the possibility of revising the language in the NERC bill in any way that would make it acceptable.  General observations about the fundamental aspects of the NERC bill indicated that people are not comfortable shifting authority away form FERC to an overly complex, prescriptive organization with uncertain delegations of enforcement authority to regional entities (apparently successors to existing Regional Reliability Councils).\n\nRegarding alternatives, there was consensus that the general approach contained in the PJM proposal, subject to additional work to resolve several weaknesses, could become an acceptable vehicle for addressing reliability issues.  While EPSA members clearly are \"leaning toward\" the PJM  bill, the proposals raises serious questions concerning: (1) the states' role regarding \"adequacy\" and their right to adopt \"more stringent\" standards based upon \"compelling need,\" even if inconsistent with national standards; and (2) limited provision for coordination with Canada and Mexico.\n\nThe PJM Proposal\n\nPJM's proposal contains a number of positive aspects, including:\n\n?Its simplicity: it is only 5 pages long.  Members and staff on Capitol Hill have repeatedly pleaded for a shorter version of reliability legislation.  The PJM proposal is at least 10 pages shorter than the NERC bill.\n\n?FERC and the RTOs would have primary jurisdiction over development and enforcement of reliability standards.  The NERC language gives substantial deference to the ERO (in all likelihood, NERC, reformed in ways that are not yet clear or certain) and accompanying ARREs (successors to the Regional Reliability Councils).\n\n?EISB - With the expected approval of the formation of EISB at the upcoming meeting of the GISB Board on September 19th, coupled with strong support from FERC Commissioners Wood, Brownell and Massey, the PJM proposal allows an opportunity to incorporate EISB.  The NERC bill is unclear how an EISB would be accommodated, if at all.\nSome issues raising concern which need to be addressed, include:\n\n?State role - the language contains a savings provision which would defer to each state to enforce standards within their boundaries.  Only through applications from affected parties can FERC review state actions and may delay such state action, although it does not specifically state that it can prevent it.\n\n?International issues - specifically interfaces with Canada and Mexico.  The language expresses the need to establish \"harmonious\" reliability standards with each country throughout the North American region.  While simply instructing FERC to do so, PJM's proposal may need to more clearly explain how to this would be accomplished.\n\n?Variances - The NERC language presently allows for interconnection wide variances.  The WSCC favors this approach and the Senate Energy Committee, with the bulk of its membership from the west region, may have something to say about the lack of ability for a region to request a variance.  Whether or not a compromise can be formulated is something we will need to explore.\n\nNext Steps\n\nThe game plan is to open a dialogue with proponents of the PJM bill in order to discuss how best to improve the language to remove potential obstacles to it's attracting wider support.  While this memo summarizes several key issues, there may be others which will need to be discussed.  Please bring these ideas up for discussion during the NAERO Working Group conference call scheduled for Tuesday, September 4 at 2:30 pm (EDT) including any suggested language and changes to improve the PJM proposal. To access the call, dial 1-800-937-6563 and ask for the EPSA/Mark Bennett call.  We are looking to begin the process of working with PJM as quickly as possible and your input is needed.  If you have any questions, please contact Mark Bennett, Manager of Policy (mbennett@epsa.org) or Donn Salvosa, Manager of Government Affairs (dsalvosa@epsa.org) at (202) 628-8200.\n\n"

Many of the changes are editorial, but some are also substantive and are based on our prior position, developed when we were working on legislation, that FERC has to create the SSO.  If we are taking the position in this document that an SSO can be created without FERC, then you may want to delete the references to FERC creating the SSO.

That was very positive.\n\n2) The agenda order was changed to allow ample time to discuss the issues.=\n=20\n\n3) Time and time again it was stated that NERC was running out of time to m=\nake the required transition. If not alternatives would be pursued; example =\nEISB\n\n4) Time and time it was stated that the Goulding task force Recommendations=\n should be taken as a package, as a necessary first step.  These include:\n\n1. Committee Representation . The Task Force recommends that the NERC Board=\n direct the standing committees to modify the standing committees represent=\nation and voting to reflect the Task Force's attached \"Initial Sectors and =\nCriteria Model.\" This Model is based on the Task Force's preference for rep=\nresentation by \"sector,\" and incorporates the Task Force's general recognit=\nion that an RTO sector should be included. The Task Force recognizes that s=\nome work remains to be done to refine the definitions of each sector and th=\ne criteria for belonging, but believes that the Initial Sectors and Criteri=\na Model is an appropriate next step and should be taken immediately. Assumi=\nng that it may take some months to put in place the details of the new Mode=\nl, including the new weighted voting procedures, the Task Force recommends =\nthat two ISO/RTO representatives be added immediately to each of the existi=\nng standing committees to provide formal representation and a voting role f=\nor ISOs/RTOs until the Initial Sectors and Criteria Model has been implemen=\nted.\n\n2. Committee Participation and Voting . The Task Force recommends open part=\nicipation in each sector, subject to certain criteria and qualifications. T=\nhe Task Force has evaluated the qualification criteria and voting procedure=\ns used in several Regions (ERCOT and MAAC), and has incorporated features o=\nf those procedures into the recommended participation and voting procedures=\n. Specifically, the Task Force recommends weighted voting by and within eac=\nh sector, similar to what is done in MAAC.\n\n3. Due Process . The new Organization Standards Process, which will be pres=\nented to the Board in October, addresses most due process issues and concer=\nns. The Task Force recommends implementing this new process immediately.\n\n4. One-Stop Shop . The Task Force favors having a single organization for d=\neveloping Reliability Standards, Market Interface Practices, and Commercial=\n Practices. The Task Force believes that NERC has an opportunity to reinven=\nt itself to become this organization, and should take definitive steps in t=\nhat direction at its October 2001 Board and Stakeholders Committee meetings=\n.\n\n5. Funding . The Task Force recommends that steps be taken immediately to d=\necouple the funding of NERC from the Regional Reliability Councils. The Fun=\nding Task Group recommendations, adopted by the Board in February 2001, sho=\nuld be pursued.\n\n6. MIC Role in Standards Approval . The Task Force recommends, as an immedi=\nate step to address concerns with the current NERC Standards Approval Proce=\nss, and to provide a \"bridge\" until the new Organization Standards process =\nis implemented, requiring the MIC to vote on all new/proposed NERC Operatin=\ng Policies and Planning Standards and report results to the Board, includin=\ng consideration of any minority positions.\n\n5) Lots of discussion about EISB and how NERC may interface with it as a po=\nssible alternative.\n\n6) Silence on the issue of \"self regulating organization\" .

This may mean putting aside some internal positions.  Cust=\nomers need to show support of the Goulding Task Force recommendations which=\n offers a package deal to move NERC forward as a single standards setting o=\nrganization for both reliability and commercial issues. The Goulding Task F=\norce recommendations do fall short of asking for NERC action.\n\nAgenda Item 5 - Scope of NERC over Commercial Issues\nTo ensure unity in appearance, customers agreed to maintain discussions in =\nfront of the Independents at a higher policy level.   Many details are need=\ned to get individual entities \"on board\" however, such details should not i=\nmpede on the ability for customers to show strong support on principles, i.=\ne.-one-stop-shop, balance of membership, etc.  Therefore, all agreed to kee=\np details out of the discussion, i.e.-funding, seats, charter, etc.\n\nThe actual SHC discussion was constructive, and persons articulated the nee=\nd for a package deal to the room. The debate brough the expected concerns o=\nf the transmission providers to the surface.  TVA (Terry Boston) was most v=\nocal about keeping NERC out of the commercial side.   Dominion Resources (G=\nlenn Ross) supported the customers' position.  PJM (Phil Harris was also su=\npportive). =20\n\nAgenda Item 6 - Independence of Security Coordinators\nComments made that this is a long standing stalemate at NERC and that NERC =\ndoes not have the authourity to require corporate independence. Suggestions=\n made to perform better and more audits.  Dave Penn brought up the memo fro=\nm Roy Thilly.  Need to ask the Board to bring this issue to FERC for resolu=\ntion.  Good arguments made by customers on need for independence in a new c=\nompetitive market structure.  FRCC (Wiley) made arguments that the NERC sho=\nuld not revamp policies to police the few bad apples.  Should deal directly=\n and specifically with the problem.=20\n\nA straw poll was taken of the persons in the room over recommending actions=\n:\n1) NERC should require corporate indepdence and ask FERC to address it.\n2) NERC should focus in on the problem Security Coordinators and take speci=\nfic actions to safeguard independent judgement (audits)\n\nThe vote was 21/24.  There were strong comments that this vote was not inte=\nnded to be an industry representative vote, only to show how split the indu=\nstry is over this issue.\n\nThe meeting adjourned for lunch and the Independents left after the meeting=\n reconvened.\nThe SHC agreed to ask the BOT the following:\n\n?=09Establish a goal/vision to become the one stop shop for development of =\nwholesale electric industry standards. =20\n?=09Add words that \"we need to go forward from where we are.\n?=09Take immediate action to adopt the initial recommendations contained in=\n new Board agenda item 22.\n?=09Actively solicit cooperation collaboration and support from Canadian an=\nd US government entities.\n?=09Facilitate - jointly with interested trade associations; federal, state=\n and provincial regulators, and other stakeholder organizations - an open a=\nnd inclusive process to achieve consensus on the definitions and attributes=\n of the functions necessary for the development of wholesale electric indus=\ntry standards and practices, an on a course of action to institute such cap=\nabilities.\n?=09Interface with state and provincial regulators to address retail operat=\nion issues as they affect wholesale operations.\n\nAgenda Item 9 -Transmission Expansion\nReference to \"incentive rates\", and \"accelerated amortization\", should be r=\nemoved, not a reliability policy need.=20\nThe reference to these expansion solutions are intended to be tutorial and =\ndoes not assume NERC will begin to undertake rate issues.  APPA - public pe=\nrception will be different.  Must remove this language.  Glen Ross will pre=\nsent this report to the Independents outlining the strong opinions on both =\nsides.\n\n"

I think it provides a model that can be used to show tangible benefits to pipeline customers, which is imperative for the ENA structure to be accepted by customers and approved by the Commission.\n\nI feel we should quickly model a real-life scenario to ensure that the cost of service benefits associated with the LLC financing, in fact, match-up with the costs of the re-purchase and subsequent inclusion in rates of the base gas.  In addition, it may be useful to \"map out\" exactly how, and in what context, the plan would be presented to the pipeline customers and Commission Staff.  I think this would largely be the responsibility of the pipeline, but thinking through the process will provide an idea of the timing associated with such an endeavor and also would surface concerns of any interface with FERC (i.e., affiliate concerns).  It is my feeling that any plan would likely be memorialized through a formal settlement agreement among pipeline, customers and Staff and be certified to the Commission.\n\nOne concern, as alluded to above, is whether the benefits of the LLC financing structure will, in fact, provide the benefits necessary to offset the costs associated with the repurchase of the base gas.  A cost of service model was created for \"rough\" evaluation purposes.  The model assumes the net proceeds from the sale of base gas are invested as equity in an LLC for purposes of financing pipeline infrastructure requirements.  The inherent cost of service savings by financing through an LLC versus traditional financing is measured and compared to the cost of service impact of the repurchase of base gas 5 years down the road.  By adjusting certain variables (ROE, gas prices, capital structure and the discount rate used for NPV purposes) the model shows the economics can in-fact work.  Applying the model to real-life is the next step.\n\nI've attached a copy of the model.  Cells highlighted in blue can be varied for sensitivity purposes.  One assumption of the model is that the LLC capitalization remains constant over time.  I don't know if that is an accurate assumption or not.\n\n "

As BP correctly notes (Petition at 4-5), the Commission did state in the Northern Border case that a pipeline should solicit turnback capacity from its shippers before filing an application to construct expansion facilities.\n\n7Northern Border Pipeline Company, 90 FERC ? 61,263 at 61,879 (2000).\n\n\nFrom \"Order Issuing Certificate\", issued March 16, 2000, Northern Border Pipeline Company, Docket Nos. CP99-21-000, CP99-21-001, and CP99-21-002 (90 FERC ? 61,263)\n\nFurther, we find below that Northern Border properly applied the Commission's policy regarding the solicitation of turnback capacity.

He said he would be sure to relay that to Brian.  His sense is that Brian is supportive of making 311 subject to Order 636 and 637 standards.\n\nBelow are some earlier communications.

Southern Union states in its initial brief (#9 below) that it opposes the high demand rates that it says EPGT proposes to charge for a service that does not incorporate the consumer protections of Order No. 636 and argues that FERC should impose Order No. 636 standards on PG&E.  I was watching a video stream of the meeting, and the whole discussion seemed to come out of nowhere.  \n\n\nHere are the facts in this case.\n\n1)\tOn December 20, 1999, PG&E Texas Pipeline, LP (the predecessor to EPGT Texas Pipeline, LP) filed a petition with FERC for approval of transportation rates under Section 311 along , as they were required to do.  (All intrastate pipelines that perform Section 311 service must either have their rates approved by FERC or they must charge rates that are approved by a state regulatory body for a similar service.)  PG&E's filing proposed, in addition to the usual interruptible service, a firm Section 311 service as well as an interruptible parking and lending service.  PG&E also filed a revised Statement of Operating Conditions to reflect the new services.\n\n2)\tOn February 25, 2000, Southern Union Gas Company, an intrastate transportation customer of PG&E, filed a late motion to intervene and raised issues which it stated should be addressed in a hearing.  PG&E opposed the late intervention, but FERC granted it on April 14, 2000.  (PG&E stated that Southern Union was intervening in order to gain leverage in renegotiating its contract for intrastate service.)\n\n3)\tSouthern Union submitted data requests to PG&E on April 13 and April 17.  PG&E attempted to get a protective order issued, but FERC rejected their request.\n\n4)\tA settlement conference was held on September 7, 2000.\n\n5)\tA Staff Panel was convened on October 2, 2000, in order to conduct an advisory, non-evidentiary proceeding for oral arguments on the issues, with instructions to make recommendations to the Commission within 90 days.\n\n6)\tOn November 1,  2000, FERC requested 5 pages of additional information from PG&E in order to complete the application in the proceeding, which PG&E provided on November 8th.  On December 8th, PG&E provided additional information in response to a FERC data request.\n\n7)\tOn January 10, 2001, Southern Union submitted a proposed alternative to the cost of service and rate design that was filed by PG&E.\n\n8)\tOn January 17, El Paso Field Services informed FERC that PG&E Texas Pipeline, LP had been acquired by El Paso on December 22, 2000, and that the name was changed to EPGT Texas Pipeline, LP.  \n\n9)\tOn January 24, 2001, EPGT Texas and Southern Union filed initial briefs.  \n\n10)\tOn July 17, 2001, EPGT filed supplemental comments in response to the discussion at FERC summarized below, where Commissioner Wood inquired about the extension of some Order No. 636 and 637 provisions to Section 311 service providers.  EPGT stated that, if FERC proceeds with this policy, it should do so in a generic rulemaking and not in an individual pipeline proceeding.  On July 30, 2001, Southern Union filed reply comments opposing EPGT's supplemental comments.\n\n11)\tOn August 3, EPGT filed an amended Statement of Operating Conditions, which provides for electronic nominations, two additional nomination cycles, bumping, clarified and updated credit provisions, modified quality provisions to protect system integrity, and more clearly defined authorized overrun service.\n\nThe NGPA gives FERC authority over intrastate pipeline rates for Section 311 service and requires that such service be provided on a non-discriminatory basis, but there is some question as to whether it gives FERC authority to require, for example, compliance with Order Nos. 636 and 637.   \n\nPlease let me know if this is enough detail (or maybe it's more than you wanted!!).\n\n\n\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tHull, Bryan  \nSent:\tMonday, August 13, 2001 2:33 PM\nTo:\tCantrell, Rebecca W.\nSubject:\tRE: Section 311\n\nBecky,\nI'm hoping you can help me with this.  I work on the Texas Gas Trading desk, and Brian Redmond asked me to find out what was at the crux of the issue in the article below.  He is drafting a letter for Commissioner Wood and wanted to reference the situation.  I thought I would ask you before I read 311 and 636 and tried to call around EPGT to get info.

The discussion came up in the context of EPGT Texas Pipeline L.P., which asked the commission to approve interstate rates for the service it provides on the intrastate pipeline. \n``In exchange for not forcing [straight fixed-variable] rate design down the throat'' of the pipeline, EPGT should be directed to comply with order 636 mandates on capacity release, electronic bulletin boards and flexible receipt and delivery points, Wood said. ``The point of 636 was to bring the benefits of competitive tools to shippers across the country,'' he said about the pipe, which is one of the nation's largest systems not under order 636 jurisdiction. The line is about 6,000 miles in length and moves about 1 Bcf/day. \nWhile Commissioner Nora Mead Brownell indicated support for Wood's position, Breathitt took up the opposition. The commissioners have talked about extending the order's reach ``for some time,'' said Breathitt. Still, there has been ``no groundswell'' for change and, for that reason, ``I would not be enthusiastic about an unwarranted expansion'' of federal authority over issues that should fall under the jurisdiction of state public utility commissions. \nBy expanding the reach of order 636 to intrastate facilities, FERC would be opening Pandora's box, Breathitt warned. The concept could be extended beyond the three topics mentioned by Wood to cover the order's Gas Industry Standards Board or discounting standards, she cautioned. In the end, such an expansion of federal authority would have the unintended consequence of ``chilling'' expansion of intrastate capacity, she warned. \nAfter the short debate, the commission declined to open a broader proceeding on Wood's proposal and struck the issue from the agenda. While insisting his focus was on EPGT, Wood, before the matter was put aside, said ``we could do it in a generic proceeding.'' \nWood also touched on the idea of mandating that EPGT make charitable contributions equal to 0.3% of its annual revenue. ``It's not bad policy to have them contribute to the community,'' said Wood. Breathitt also endorsed the concept, saying ``there is ratepayer benefit to charitable contributions.'' \nThe other commissioners were far less enthusiastic. Brownell said the problem with such a mandate is that ratepayers would have no opportunity to comment on the way those contributions are made. ``Ratepayers should be not taxed without a vote,'' she said. \nHebert and Commissioner William Massey agreed that corporations should make contributions on their own and that the commission should stay clear. More generally, Hebert explained that his preference is to give deference to state regulators on these matters. Let's see if state officials ``want us to reach into their business,'' Hebert said."

                "Content": " JSTEFFE (Non-Privileged).pst\n\nMiguel,\n\nTo further clarify the CNG settlement provision with regard to Base Gas sales please see the following.\n\n\"CNG will credit to its customers through the TCRA any net proceeds from such sales above net book value up to a cumulative level of the costs that CNG has recovered from its customers through the stranded cost surcharge under Section 18.2.A of the General Terms and Conditions of its Tariff.  In addition, CNG will credit to its rate base one half of any cumulative net proceeds from such sales that are in excess of the cumulative amount collected under Section 18.2.A, and CNG will retain the other half.\"\n\nSection 18.2.A of CNG's tariff provides for the recovery of Stranded Costs (as a result of Order 636 or its progeny).  Examples of stranded costs that are potentially eligible for recovery under this section are storage facilities, production facilities, product extraction facilities and transmission facilities that have been rendered no longer used or useful as a result of the pipeline's compliance with Order 636.\n\nBasically, the level of gains to be retained by CNG is dependent upon the level of stranded costs (facility costs -  e.g. losses on sale of gathering facilities) incurred by CNG and collected from its customers.  It is simply a netting mechanism (losses and gains) to address customer concerns that the pipeline could potentially recover its losses on the sale of assets as stranded costs, and also retain the gains on the sale of assets, including base gas.\n\nThe TCRA (Transition Cost Rate Adjustment) account is a convenient surcharge mechanism used by the pipeline to, among other things, flow-through such gains covered by the stipulation and applicable tariff provisions. \n\nRequiring clarification with CNG, the following is how I think this mechanism would work.\n\nIf CNG incurred and collected cumulative stranded costs of $100 and experienced a gain of $50 on the sale of base gas, CNG would credit the entire $50 to its customers through the TCRA.  \n\nIf the gain were $150 on the sale of base gas, CNG would credit $100 to the TCRA, credit its Rate Base with $25 and retain $25.  \n\nIn the best case scenario (i.e. past cumulative gains are equal are greater than cumulative stranded costs) CNG would be able to keep all the cash from the future sales of base gas, but would be required to credit rate base in the amount of 50% of the gain and recognize the other 50% as extraordinary income.  While there are probably some reports CNG has filed detailing the cumulative level of stranded costs recovered under 18.2.A and the gains realized on the sale of assets offsetting such stranded costs, this would be something the regulatory folks at CNG could verify.\n\nHope this helps.  If you further questions please let me know."

Upon further reflection, Chuck thinks that, in order for the law firm to provide a useful and informative document, the memo must be pipeline specific.  He thinks that he can prepare the memo within the time frame discussed (aiming for end of July 4 week but no later than mid-July), for about $30,000 (plus costs, estimated to be about $5,000).  However, in order to meet this time frame, they will need some upfront information.  Specifically:\n\n1.\tBased on the three pipelines we discussed, they would like to get the FERC case docket numbers where FERC \tissued certificates for the particular storage facilities being considered.  Because these pipelines have many \tstorage fields, it will save a lot of time and money to have these docket numbers up front.   The pipelines should \thave this information available.  If we cannot narrow down the facilities that we're looking at, the law firm's \t\tresponse memo will not be as useful and they may not be able to meet our timing requests.\n\n2.\tAdditionally, the law firm would like to have all of the settlements and side agreements that the pipelines have\tentered into with its customers regarding the storage facilities at issue.  The law firm's analysis will be impacted \tby these agreements, and obtaining the settlements from public records would be time consuming and costly, \tand side agreements are not publicly filed.\n\nIn order to access this information, it will be most efficient if our regulatory people meet with the pipelines' regulatory people to obtain the exact information that we need for the analysis.  Please let us know if this is doable.\n\nOne last point, Chuck asked if we would know by Monday whether we want to engage the firm for the work.  I told him we won't know before Wednesday, and he said that is fine, but the longer we wait to engage the firm, the further we push the date out for when the firm will get us a final product.  Just something to keep in mind.\n\nAlso, Donna's computer is broken and she cannot send emails, so she asked me to send this message about her follow up discussion with Henry May:  Henry May estimates that his firm can do the work for approximately $30,000.  However, he is making no promises about the result, and Donna got the impression that, even after we spend $30,000 for his analysis, his end result may be that we cannot do the deal.  Henry did mention, however, that a partner of his worked on a financing deal for Enron regarding Bamel Storage.  Robert Neustadter is looking into that transaction further.\n\nThanks\n\nSarah"

                "Content": " JSTEFFE (Non-Privileged).pst\n\n\nThis note is to report on two electricity legislative developments: the Aug. 2nd introduction of an anti-RTO bill (or at least anti-mandatory RTOs) and on a meeting I had yesterday afternoon with Andy Black, the policy coordinator for Chairman Joe Barton on the House Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee, to discuss their intentions with respect to electricity legislation this Fall.\n\n1.  H.R. 2814 (Reps. Tom Sawyer (D-OH) and Richard Burr (R-NC))\n\nOn Aug. 2nd (the last day Congress was in session before the August Recess), the above named members of the House Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee introduced H.R. 2814, the Interstate Transmission Act.  The legislation is bad because, among other things, it requires FERC to establish transmission pricing policies that provide incentives for voluntary participation and formation of RTOs, with language prohibiting policies that have the effect of forcing transmitting utilities to join RTOs.  Also objectionable is that the bill would \"limit\" pancaking but at the same time require FERC to establish a \"reasonable transition mechanism or period\" for additive charges.  The legislation prohibits FERC from conditioning any order upon a transmitting utility being required to transfer operational control of jurisdictional facilities to an ISO or RTO.  The bill would require that participating transmitting utilities must approve the form, structure and operating entity of any RTO.\n\nIn addition to the RTO language, the bill has the \"old\" version of the NERC reliability legislation in it.  The bill also has a PUHCA exemption for RTOs, repeals Federal Power Act sec. 203 on the disposition of property and includes the tax changes that IOUs seek for transfers of property to an independent transmission company.\n\nBarbara Hueter advises that First Energy has its hq in Rep. Sawyer's district.  Rep. Burr is from North Carolina, so perhaps Duke had its utility hat on in working with him.  I am checking into where Duke is on this issue.  Rep. Burr is the Vice Chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and close to Chairman Tauzin -- so his support for this legislation is significant (see Andy Black comment below).\n\n2.  Andy Black Meeting\n\nAndy is meeting with various trade associations this month to discuss electricity legislation.  He is only meeting with a few companies on a one-on-one basis -- Enron, Reliant, Dynegy and TXU.  His timing is to have a legislative draft for Chairman Barton to review when Congress returns after Labor Day.  If Chairman Barton approves or makes changes, the draft will be circulated to members of the subcommittee and the public for further comment.  The intent is to mark up an electricity bill this Fall so that if the Senate acts on electricity in its comprehensive energy bill, the issue will be ripe for consideration in a House-Senate conference committee.  Here is a run down of my comments and Andy's comments on specific issues.\n\na.   RTOs\n\nChairman Barton supports RTOs.  At a minimum, the draft will affirm FERC's authority as the commissioners have requested.  Andy is considering going beyond that to mandate RTO participation.  Not sure he can hold that position in the subcommittee.  He is looking to Enron and others to help them explain and build support for RTOs.  Informed him of our initial informal coalition steps.  However, Andy asked me to look at sec. 3 of the Sawyer-Burr referenced above, which I realized after the meeting is the part that deals with incentive rates and negotiated rates to expand transmission and voluntary RTOs.  I have a call in to Andy to reconcile these statements since the Sawyer-Burr bill is based on voluntary RTOs.  Hopefully, he is thinking of using the incentive and negotiated rate language and NOT the objectionable voluntary RTO aspects.  I will strongly encourage him to \"do the right thing\" in that regard.\n\nb.   PUHCA\n\nThe draft will use the Pickering bill (H.R. 1101).  Told Andy about our concerns with the record keeping provisions of that bill.  Will send him our legislative language to clarify these provisions so that they do not open up all of Enron's records -- even those unrelated to transactions with a regulated utility affiliate.\n\nc.  PURPA\n\nProspective repeal.  On back up power, they are thinking of requiring that rates for back up power be just and reasonable until there is retail competition in the state.\n\nd.   Interconnection\n\nThey have received a proposal from Trigen that Andy says we will like.  I am contacting EPSA to get the details.\n\ne.   Net Metering\n\nThey are likely to include the Inslee bill to require \"net metering.\"  I explained our concern that the bill's mandate applies to all retail energy suppliers -- including EES -- even though this should only apply to utilities with an obligation to serve; that it does not make sense to mandate it on service providers like EES (per Jim's helpful comments yesterday).  I need to get more information to Andy.\n\nf.   Transmission Jurisdiction\n\nThankfully, Andy is NOT going to use those portions of the bill as reported by subcommittee in the last Congress that gave use heart burn on jurisdiction.  Specifically, the draft will not say FERC does not have jurisdiction over the transportation component of a bundled retail sale -- the draft will not get into the bundled/unbundled issue at all.  The draft will bring munis, co-ops and PMAs under the FERC umbrella for transmission jurisdiction purposes.\n\ng.   Siting\n\nOn siting, Andy is thinking of some type of mechanism that would give a State one year before federal eminent domain attaches.\n\nh.   Reliability\n\nOn a negative note, Andy intends to use the latest NERC reliability language because NERC's version has strong support among the Members of the subcommittee and no other alternative has emerged with political support (i.e., not PJM).  I explained our concerns.  He said our best bet is for DoE or FERC to come forward to seek something other than the NERC version.  He said Members eyes glaze over on reliability with everything else on the plate.\n\ni.   Negawatts\n\nI raised the absence of negawatts on his issue list.  He said he is open to considering it again, but that there was left over political baggage and unresolved issues from when this was attempted during consideration of the \"California bill\" earlier this summer.\n\nYour questions and comments on the any of the above are most welcome."

Ho=\nwever, since complete consensus was not reached, FERC should provide its de=\ntermination of which of the two models best meets FERC's expectations as a =\nplatform for the SE Power Grid RTO.  This should be done by FERC quickly.  =\nThere should be no further delay.  Regardless of the model, FERC should enc=\nourage the collaborative process.  She thinks that this should be done by t=\nhe parties without FERC intervention except to the extent to respond to FER=\nC orders. (I think FERC staff should be involved or it will get bogged down=\n).  Parties should reconvene within 15 days after FERC's order adopting a m=\nodel and the FERC order should direct the participants (like us) to submit =\na joint proposal within 45 days thereafter.  She recommends to FERC that pa=\nrties be allowed to file comments to FERC within 20 days (however, she reco=\nmmends against permitting reply comments since they may prove counterproduc=\ntive to the collaborative nature of the mediation process.)  The Commission=\n will then issue an order that can adopt her recommendations, may reject he=\nr recommendations, or change something.  I would expect that the Commission=\n would adopt many of her recommendations, while allowing further mediated-t=\nype discussions on some issues (hopefully, FERC will adopt many of our sugg=\nested changes).  Judge McCartney then basically describes both proposals of=\n the Grid Group and the Southern, etal. group, then provides the stakeholde=\nr participants' comments (almost verbatim from all submissions to her).

This is good because Enron generally favors the Grid =\nmodel. However, she does provide the Commission information on Southern, et=\nal.'s proposal (independent system administrator--like National Grid-type) =\nin her report, even though she has concerns that the Southern, etal model i=\ns not Order No. 2000 compliant.  The Southern, etal. model has a hybrid phy=\nsical congestion management with day ahead balanced schedule requirements a=\nnd LMP in real time (with penalties) and significant control area responsib=\nilities.  The significant aspects of the Grid model are discussed below:=20\nGrid Governance: RTO is a for profit transco with an independent board and =\nan enhancement:  the Independent Market Administrator (IMA).  The IMA was a=\ndded to facilitate public power participation (worried that transmission ow=\nner on top, even if divested from generation, would favor its transmission =\nsolutions over generation or other transmission solution).  The IMA would a=\ndminister the markets; exercise operational authority over the transmission=\n system; administer one OASIS (with one process for interconnection and tra=\nnsmission requests); and assume the Security Coordinator function.  She str=\nongly encourages this split.=20\nGood stakeholder advisory Committee (provides majority and minority views) =\nand an independent Market Monitor to monitor the RTO and the markets=20\nAllows for Independent Transmission Companies (Entergy wants to be one), wi=\nth RTO oversight=20\nDescribes that control area operators will initially maintain their control=\n areas for physical operation, such as switching transmission elements, pur=\nsuant to operating procedures approved by the RTO/IMA.

(Protocols should be=\n subject to further discussion)=20\nRTO/transco has primary responsibility for tariff administration, including=\n rate changes and tariff filings=20\nAll load under the rates, terms and conditions of OATT (GridSouth group has=\n appealed this part of earlier Commission orders, and, thus, retains their =\nrights should they win on appeal)=20\n4 transmission pricing zones initially: Entergy, Southern, GridSouth, and G=\nridFlorida.  Allows for participant funded, direct assigned, and merchant t=\nransmission.  Transmission rates to loads in RTO will be zonal (for existin=\ng facilities) and regional charge (for new facilities, other than those abo=\nve).  There will be one \"through and out rate\", plus a Grid Management Char=\nge for RTO operation.=20\nEncourages conversion of existing transmission agreements to OATT=20\nFinancial Rights/LMP (includes \"real time spot market\") is clearly the pref=\nerred model and represents best practices model (from PJM and SPP) -- many =\ndetails need to be worked out in continued discussions.

(1) Many a=\nre still concerned that FERC had not conducted a \"cost-benefit\" analysis an=\nd had concerns over the costs.  She responds that extrapolation of costs to=\n the entire SE RTO seems unwarranted because it ignores the \"economies of s=\ncale\" and initial reliance on existing control centers and infrastructure. =\n In any event, FERC could explore the feasibility of a rate setting process=\n that would involve the state commissions. (2) concerned about cost shiftin=\ng:  mediation team discussed phase in of rates that the Commission has allo=\nwed. (3) Concern that SE RTO would preempt state ability to approve asset t=\nransfers to RTO and want state retail customers to receive full value for a=\nssets.  (4) concern that SE RTO may prematurely put Southern states into re=\ntail open access (concerns with Cal.)

                "Content": " JSTEFFE (Non-Privileged).pst\n\nYesterday afternoon, September 17, the Judge in the Northeast RTO mediation proceeding issued his report to the Commission on the 45-day mediation session.  Although not unexpected, but still disappointing, the Judge endorses the market design proposal of the New York and New England ISOs.  This market design proposal encompasses a long, drawn out process for discussing what the Northeast market should look like (minimum 12 months) before work begins to develop the new RTO.  The target implementation date of the ISOs is November, 2004, but the proposal clearly states that this time frame is \"subject to extension\" if new design requirements are introduced.  We believe the true intent of the ISOs is to delay indefinitely this process in order to retain the three existing ISO structures.  A copy of the Judge's report and the Business Plan are attached.\n\nOne good aspect of the Judge's report is that he asks in several areas of the report for Commission guidance.  We too believe this is necessary.  It became quite evident early in the mediation proceeding that we were not going to agree with the New York entities (or the New England ISO) on market design or governance.  We argued that FERC intended the new market design to be primarily the PJM system, with enhancements where possible.  Others, relying on the ambiguity in FERC's orders, argued that FERC really intended to create a new system, using PJM as the platform but pulling heavily from the other two ISOs, regardless of time or complication of creating this new market.  We need FERC direction on this, and the Judge makes this clear.\n\nBackground\n\nThe Judge's primary goal of this 45-day mediation process was simply to establish a \"business plan\" which lays out how and when a single Northeast RTO will be created.  Enron, along with many other participants, opposed this approach, arguing that we are wasting the 45 days given to us by the Commission.  The Judge acknowledges in his report that there was significant opposition to his approach but he thinks it worked out perfectly.  Although the majority of the Judge's report and the business plan focuses mainly on process for creating the business plan, he does discuss two substantive issues:  market design and governance.\n\nMarket Design\n\nAt the beginning of the mediation, PJM, NY and NE submitted a joint proposal for forming a single Northeast RTO.  This proposal envisions a time-intensive approached designed to reach agreement by all stakeholders, with an implementation date in 3-4 years (\"Option 1-M\"of the Business Plan).  This proposal is now supported by the New England and New York ISOs - PJM has its own approach (see below).  The New York transmission owners also submitted a proposal for implementing the new RTO in 3 years (\"Option 2-M\" of the Business Plan).   PJM submitted an alternative proposal for creating and implementing a single Northeast RTO with a single day-ahead and real-time energy market by November 2003 (\"Option 3-M\" of the Business Plan).  \n\nWe took the lead in creating a coalition of marketers, generators, PJM TOs, industrials, and other end use customers (The One RTO Coalition) advocating the creation of a single energy market based on PJM's system by December 2002, but no later than May, 2003.  Although we (Enron) believe PJM's November 2003 time frame is too conservative, the coalition supports Option 3-M (PJM's approach) since it achieves the Coalition's goals, albeit on a slower timetable.  \n\nAs noted above, the Judge endorses Option 1-M, in part because it has a built-in a process for determining \"Best Practices.\"  Although PJM also conducted a \"best practices\" analysis, the other ISOs and NY TOs do not agree with PJM's determinations of what practices from their ISOs are \"best practices.\"  \n\nThe Judge acknowledges that support for Option 3-M (the PJM plan) \"far outstrips\" the other options in diversity and extent of stakeholder support.  However, the Judge believes that the PJM option assumes the PJM platform can work in New York and New England, even though there are more generation divestiture and load pocket issues in New York and New England than in PJM.  The Judge states that \"impatience, haste and greed\" should not be permitted to drive the RTO process \"at the expense of sound policy\" and that optimal RTO benefits should not be sacrificed in order to allow some to \"exploit more immediate economic opportunity in a sprint.\" See Report, page 18.\n\nGovernance\n\nThe other substantive issues we have discussed are governance:  interim governance, final governance, board make-up and stakeholder process.  The Judge opted to not endorse any one of the options proposed - instead, he discusses the pros and cons of each option.  Here again, the Judge strongly urges the Commission to provide guidance to the participants on the Commission's preferred governance approach.  The Judge also suggests that a settlement judge may be helpful in assisting stakeholders in finalizing governance procedures.\n\nPJM has stated that in order to meet its deadline of November 2003 (and certainly earlier), PJM has to be in control of the implementation of the new RTO.  PJM proposes that the new board be made up of board members from the existing ISOs:  5 from PJM, 3 from New York, and 2 from New England.  The Board elects a voting CEO (assumed to be Phil Harris if the PJM proposal wins).  \n\nNY ISO, New England ISO, NY PSC, NY TOs and New England TOs, along with other entities (primarily those who are afraid to cross New York PSC) all support equal representation on the new Board.  One proposal would have 3 board members from each ISO with a non-voting CEO.  The other proposal would have 3 board members from each ISO with 4 additional board members to be elected by stakeholders.  \n\nWe support the PJM board make-up proposal to ensure a fast transition to a single Northeast RTO and energy market based on the PJM system.\n\nPost Mediation\n\nThe Judge in his report recommends that the Commission issue an order resolving as many of the issues in dispute as possible and then establish further proceedings under the auspice of a settlement judge.  \n\nThe Judge urges the Commission to not accept comments from participants, but he acknowledges that all participants want an opportunity to comment.  We are working on two sets of comments now, one on our own and one in conjunction with the One RTO Coalition.  We will circulate drafts as soon as they are prepared.\n\nAlthough we are disappointed that the Judge did not endorse the PJM proposal, we still believe that the Commission is intent on implementing a single northeast RTO as soon as possible and that the PJM proposal provides a well-reasoned (even conservative) approach to reaching that goal.  Therefore, even though the Judge sided with New York, we are hopeful that the Commission will stick to its guns and go with the PJM proposal.\n\nPlease call any one of us if you have any questions or would like to discuss the Report.\n\nSarah, Dan, Howard and Tom\n\n \t\t \n\n"

                "Content": " JSTEFFE (Non-Privileged).pst\n\nPer your request, here is the status of two issues we are addressing which are currently on the radar screen at FERC.\n\nReporting Requirements for Sales to California\n\nOn July 25, 2001, FERC issued an Order imposing reporting requirements on natural gas sales to California.  The order affects transporters and LDCs as well as sellers.  FERC has provided templates which parties must use in compiling the reports, which are due thirty days after the end of the month.  Sellers are required to report all their sales that are made either at the California border or within the state on a daily basis.  They must also report separately the transportation component and the gas commodity component of the price for each sales contract.  In essence, the FERC requirement assumes that sellers can track individual packages of gas from the wellhead to the point of sale.\n\nENA/EES are filing a request for rehearing of the Order, arguing:\n\n1.\tThat it is an error to formalize the reporting requirements.  They should only be in place on an ad hoc basis to allow FERC to collect and review data for the periods of time that an actual situation deserving of analysis exists.  The formalized and generally applicable requirements adopted go far beyond the scope of FERC's authority.\n2.\tThat FERC must properly assess the time and work burden on the companies subject to the requirements.  Neither ENA nor EES manage their business in a way that would allow them to extract the required information without making arbitrary, after-the-fact determinations of which purchases were made for which customers, and this would involve significant manual intervention.  The Gas Operations group, who have been evaluating our systems to determine how we could comply, believe that it may be necessary to assign at least one person full-time to the task of compiling the data.  Therefore, reporting entities should not be required to supply \"manufactured data\" simply to complete the forms.\n3.\tThat FERC should extend the deadline for reporting to 45 days from the end of the reporting month.  The personnel in gas accounting who will have to extract the data are busiest at the first of the month.  Extending the deadline to mid-month would make compliance easier and more accurate.\n\nThe first two arguments are generally the same ones we made when we filed comments in the original NOPR.  \n\nMarketing Affiliate NOPR\n\nIt is almost certain that FERC will issue a NOPR sometime in September to address possible changes in the marketing affiliate rule.  Some issues that we expect to be addressed include expanding the definition of marketing affiliates to include electric generators and some further tightening of the regulations in response to the \"funny money\" issue that certain parties keep bringing up.  \n\nWe have gotten informal feedback that certain staff persons at FERC are questioning why they have not been hearing from marketing affiliates while the pipelines and their association have been coming in arguing against any changes to the rule.  Therefore, we have tentatively scheduled a meeting next week, while we are in D.C. for a technical conference on the El Paso Reallocation issues, to meet with selected staff personnel to discuss the reasons we do not see any need for changes, although we are willing to accept a designation of affiliates engaged in electric generation development as marketing affiliates.  This position should not disadvantage us in any way, since we fall under the designation anyway because of our organizational structure.  We are also developing data on our firm contracts with the Enron pipelines in anticipation of responding to the NOPR.\t"

The order is fairly terse, and just says \"and if it so recalled (by PG&E), that Enron may further recall the capacity for its own use in the PG&E  service territory upon 24 hours notice.\"  The language says to me that you can recall it 24 hours before you want to use it.  However, I can call El Paso and find out how they interpret it.\n\nAs to the \"traditional rate making\" valuation of the $58 million, I have to confess I don't understand what you mean.  PG&E paid the 58 million as part of a negotiated settlement.  Typically that is part of a black box settlement, meaning that revenue dollars are not tracked to particular costs.

                "Content": " JSTEFFE (Non-Privileged).pst\n\n\nThe ERCOT Board approved the congestion zones for next year, 2001. The ERCO=\nT Board accepted the 3 CSC 4 CM Zone model for use in commercial congestion=\n management for 2002.  Effective date is January 1, 2002.  The three CSC's =\nare Graham-Parker 345 kV DCKT, Sandow-Temple 345 kV DCKT and STP-DOW 345 kV=\n DCKT.  The four CM Zones are West02, North02, South02 and Houston02.  A po=\nwer point presentation along with a map is available at ftp://ftp.ercot.com=\n/CSCDATA/csc.htm. =20\n\nCurrent Congestion Cost and Outlook.  The congestion charges that have been=\n incurred are 55.6 million or 137 million depending on the methodology used=\n to calculate the charge. If you look purely at the scheduled MWs then it i=\ns 137 MM based upon the ERCOT protocols. The actual cost to redispatch and =\nclear congestion as of Sept. 22, 2001 was 55.6 MM. Both obviously are very =\nhigh considering it is for one month of operation.=20\nWhen the 20 MM trigger was hit August 14, 2001, ERCOT has 6 month by Protoc=\nol and reaffirmed in the commission order to implement the full zonal model=\n. This means that there will no longer be an uplift of interzonal congestio=\nn, rather a direct assignment of the charge. The charge may be partially of=\nfset by the TCR that will be auctioned. The PUCT has indicated an interest =\nto move to direct assignment prior to the development and implementation of=\n a TCR instrument as a hedge.  I am chairing the congestion management work=\ning group that is deciding the TCR issue and will be dealing with the local=\n congestion issues when that trigger has been hit.  I will attach a copy of=\n the current draft of the TCR white paper.  In short, the TCR is a financia=\nl option that can be purchased as hedge against zonal congestion.  There is=\n no physical requirement for the TCR in that you do not have to physically =\nschedule to receive the benefit of the TCR.  There will be an auction on or=\n about the 4th of February, 2002 and the full zonal implementation will tak=\ne place February 15, 2002.  The tentative schedule is as follows:\n?=0910/5/01 - Distribute draft TCR White Paper\n?=0910/22/01 - Review and edit draft TCR White Paper\n?=0910/30/01 - Distribute TCR White Paper to WMS\n?=0911/1/01 - WMS Meeting; vote on PRR\n?=0911/8/01 - TAC Meeting\n?=0911/19/01 - Board Meeting\n?=0912/4/01 - ERCOT issues notice of TCR Auction\n?=092/15/02 - First effective date of TCRs and direct assignment of CSC Con=\ngestion Costs\n=20\nCapacity Auction.  The capacity auction workshops have begun to rework that=\n capacity rule and problems experienced with the last round.  There was an =\ninitial discussion on the problems that were experienced with credit and ho=\nw the standard was one-way and the buyers of capacity were left without rec=\nourse.  There was a subsequent conference call with the credit professional=\ns to discuss the issues ( I did not participate) and there will be an addit=\nional meeting on the 19th.  The purpose of the short-term meeting are to re=\nctify issues such as credit and documents prior to the March and July 2002 =\nauctions.  Substantive issues such as the actual products, zone determinati=\non and the auction process will be part of a rulemaking prior to the Septem=\nber 2002 auction which includes annual products.=20\n\nProtocol Implementation.  ERCOT is in the process of determining what shoul=\nd be included in the Phase II design which will begin January 2001.  There =\nis a priority list that is currently under review by ERCOT vendors to deter=\nmine lead times of Phase II items in an attempt to deliver Phase II items A=\nSAP.  Parviz Adib from MOD stressed that there are certain issues that the =\nPUCT expects to be addressed in Phase II.  Issues that do not require major=\n system changes might still be doable in Phase II if the PRR Process is sta=\nrted immediately.  There is a placeholder in the Protocols related to BULs =\nand loads acting as resources.\n\nMechanism for Simultaneous Procurement of Ancillary Services.   The PUCT ha=\ns expressed concern that there could be price reversals associated with the=\n ancillary services market (if it is assumed that the various ancillary ser=\nvices have different levels of value to the market).  The Board had approve=\nd a contingency plan to allow price modifications in the early markets, how=\never the plan has not been implemented.  The WMS discussed, at length, the =\nissue of simultaneously clearing all three markets - non-spinning, regulati=\non, and responsive reserve.  A task force was formed to initially identify =\nthe principles for developing a mechanism for simultaneous procurement of a=\nncillary services issue.  It was suggested that a consultant be hired to de=\nvelop Protocol language once the principles are identified.  The first task=\n force meeting was cancelled and has not been rescheduled. =20\n\nDemand-Side Task Force.  Jay Zarnikau reported on activities of the Demand-=\nSide Task Force that is addressing Balancing Up Load (BUL) Market Issues an=\nd other demand-side issues.  The PUCT expects the full functionality to be =\nin place on January 1, 2002.  The DSTF met last on October 1st (third meeti=\nng).  The DSTF completed a draft status report on Demand-Side Resources and=\n Demand Responsiveness.  It was noted that the work of the DSTF is not comp=\nlete and has not been approved by any ERCOT Committee or the Board.  Howeve=\nr, ERCOT was required to file a report on these issues in the STF Report.  =\nThe report reviews the policy considerations that have prompted interest in=\n the demand side of ERCOT's market, reviews the PUCT's directive, reviews t=\nhe role of demand-side resources in ERCOT's markets, and identifies the iss=\nues and impediments that the DSTF is presently addressing.  It also summari=\nzes the options discussed by the DSTF to date.  The PUCT staff has suggeste=\nd that ERCOT hire a consultant, such as Eric Hirsch, to provide more resour=\nces for this effort.  The group expects to wrap up BUL issues and address d=\nirect load control issues at its next meeting.\n\nUnit Specific Deployments.  At the next WMS meeting October 24, 2001, there=\n will be a discussion regarding unit specific deployments and ERCOT will di=\nscuss the issues and the difficult that participants are having to meet the=\n ramp rates of the deployments.  The WMS will develop a list of issues and =\ncase studies for ERCOT to discuss.  The WMS also briefly discussed PRR 282 =\nrelated to defining OOME as an Instructed Deviation."

Also, if we have not started to do so, we need to catalogue, irregularities that we see or perceive in the market.  Especially, in the time that we are communicating with ERCOT and the Commission, specific well documented examples are compelling and assist us as we further our advocacy\n\nPre Day One-Scheduling/Bidding.  In the bidding of ancillary services at least two QSEs (Dynegy and TXU), did not bid into the market.  The price cleared however, there was an insufficiency was declared and the market was re-opened and cleared at 80% by rule.\n\nDay One Operations.  The ERCOT main server failed and market participants were asked to schedule via the OASIS and the portal when it became operational.  Market participants were asked to schedule via the OASIS and Portal/API.  ERCOT cancelled certificates that allowed them to look at QSE data and systems, in doing so they also cancelled the certificates that allowed internal systems to communicate.\n\nBalancing Energy Problems.  There have been continued problems with the balancing energy and the first issue is the way it is being calculated.  When calculating balancing energy requirements, the operator looks at the load forecast and the QSE schedules and an initial amount is determined.  Then the system will look at the resource plans which have not been updated frequently and then will override the previous calculation for balancing energy.  The reason the system looks at the resource plan is to control/relieve local congestion.  The problem is that settlements are based on the schedule and not the resource plan and ERCOT has not had the ability to override the system to account for the error in the resource plan.  One, ERCOT has determined a way to override the system to account for the inaccurate resource plans.  Two, ERCOT has discussed with ESCA changes to the system so that the system will look as SCADA data rather than the resource plan for clearing local congestion.\n\nPart Two.  Recently there have been discrepancies on the price awarded for B/E in the market and the amount credited to the settlement statement.  Also, deployment was based incorrectly on unit specific instructions that were supposed to be zonal or ERCOT wide.  The incorrect coding was located and corrected.  Subject to what happens today, the systems seems to be operating correctly."

                "Content": " jsteffe (Non-Privileged).pst\n\nINTERNAL COMMUNICATION REGARDING DELAYS \nIN RETAIL COMPETITION IN TEXAS\nOctober 29, 2001\n\nThe main purpose of this memo is to inform EPMI and EES commercial teams regarding the implementation status of retail competition Texas, particularly in non-ERCOT regions, which  include parts of the areas served by the following utilities:\n\n?\tSouthwestern Electric Power Company (SWEPCO) and West Texas Utilities Company (WTU) - both in the SPP region\n?\t      Entergy Gulf States (EGSI) - in the Energy-SERC region\n\nAs most of you probably have heard, the Texas Utility Commission has been examining, in the last few weeks, the readiness to implement retail competition in those areas. \n\nThe Public Utility Commission of Texas (Staff) has filed petitions seeking a determination of whether market institutions are ready for retail competition in above areas, to start January 01, 2002.\n\nThere is a concern among the Commission and many other participants that non-ERCOT-Texas regions are not ready for competition. This concern has two major causes:\n-\tLack of a vibrant, efficient wholesale market in those regions, where newly established REPs could have full access to others suppliers, on a non-discriminatory basis\n-\t      Lack of success in the retail pilot programs developed in 2001 - no alternative suppliers and no customer shifting at all; a recent hearing has confirmed most REPs absolute lack of interest in those regions - at least for the time being\n\nSPP\n\nLast Week, the Public Utility Commission decided to delay competition in SPP Texas. Or, more accurately, \"to delay customer choice\", in the Commission preferred language.  Enron, who was requested to file a testimony, opposed to any delays, under the argument that SPP is not a \"perfect market\", but REPs could trade in this market as other marketers do.\n\nNo final dates have been established yet. However, one estimates that the delay may vary from 12 to 18 months.\n\nThe Commission has established some clear actions and milestones before retail competition is implemented:\n-\tSupport SPP to begin wholesale market operations, which involves refinements and upgrades in a few of existing systems, such as settlement;\n-\t      Reform in SPP Tariffs and implementation of a market based congestion management;\n-\t      Continue the pilot, attract new competitors and open the market.\n\n\nAs part of this effort, the Commission created a Southwest Power Pool Market Readiness Implementation Project (Docket # 24869) to develop the necessary steps to transition to full competition, identify milestones, monitor progress and report to the Commission on a regular basis. Enron will be supporting this effort.\n\n\nSERC\n\nSERC regions bear resemblance with SPP, in terms of Commission's intent to delay competition. The most important difference is that the incumbent utility, EGSI, an Entergy subsidiary, has strongly supported timely implementation. The Commission fears that Entergy will benefit from its \"monopolistic\"  position in the region, in the absence of other REPs.\n\nNo final decisions have been made yet. Entergy Gulf States, in conjunction with the Commission Staff and other interested parties have gone through a settlement process, whereby retail competition will be delayed until September 15, 2002.\n\nThe subject is still being examined by the Commission and no final decisions have been made. However, we expect the Commission to approve the Settlement Agreement, therefore delaying competition until September 15, 2002.\n\n\nERCOT\n\nAll the discussion about delays in competition focuses on non-ERCOT Texas only.\n\nThere are rumors and ongoing discussions about delaying competition in ERCOT-Texas, which is scheduled to take place on  January 01, 2002. For example, Nancy Hetrich from Enron, will be attending the Legislative Oversight Committee on Friday, November 02. She will be appearing in her capacity of Chair of RMS Sub-Committee.\n\nContrary to non-ERCOT, there is a strong support from  most industry participants to have retail competition on time. Besides, the results from the pilots were successful and ERCOT is supposed to provide vibrant wholesale competition. Therefore, unlike SPP and Entergy, there should be no material reasons or fears to delay retail competition in ERCOT-Texas.\n\nWe will keep you apprised as things evolve.\n"

Having the key issues presented in one place was very helpful.\n\nTo follow up on the meeting, the following are action items for the group.\n\n1.\tDecember 1 Market Readiness Update Meeting\n\nThane Twiggs (wholesale) and Nancy Hetrick (retail) will have at this time an understanding of the billing and settlement issues (or not) with their respective areas.  We need to ensure that EES and EPMI are able to get the necessary information to make sure that their bills and settlements are working and that we can bill our retail customers.  I will ask Linda Noske to set up this meeting.  If anyone hears anything else about the market delay, please let Jean Ryall know immediately.  As of right now, it is my impression that we all agree there is no delay scheduled???\n\n2.\tCongestion Pass thru to EES' Retail Customers\n\nThane Twiggs, Nancy Hetrick and Jim Steffes will get with EWS and EES counter parties to try and work through the ability of EES passing thru congestion to its customers per the contract language.  I will lead the process of consulting with EES legal.\n\n3.\tWholesale Issues (Thane Twiggs)\n\na.\tDefine workable TCR Product \nb.\tEnd Balanced Schedule requirement \nc.\tFix Capacity Auction process, including credit matters\nd.\tBENA/OOM/AS\ne.\tSettlement & Billing\n\n4.\tRetail Issues\n\na.\tREP - ISO - Utility Interface (Nancy Hetrick)\nb.\tReliant PTB (Pat Keene)\nc.\tTXU PTB (Pat Keene)\nd.\tReliant Negative CTC (Pat Keene)\ne.\tTXU Negative CTC (Pat Keene)\nf.\tEES / EPMI License (Gloria Ogenyi + Nancy Hetrick)\n\n5.\tInformation Flow\n\nAll policy statements from anyone within Government Affairs should be first vetted with Jean Ryall to ensure consistency and conformity.  Also, all people on the TO: list above should be included on all e-mail traffic.  I know this may sometimes slow down response to business people, but I think that we can all agree that no one has all the information in this very fast moving environment and unless we have a central clearinghouse we may send the wrong messages.\n\nIt is also critical that all commercial people interested in Texas need to hear about the latest.  By having Jean Ryall in the center, she will be able to ensure that no one feels \"cut out\".\n\nThe bi-weekly meeting should be held with Jean Ryall as Host to follow these issues in a timely manner.  \n\n6.\tWholesale Products\n\nThane Twiggs was going to keep the team apprised of our products and pricing info on a regular basis so we are informed about the market.\n\nFinally, it is critical that everyone work together to get the best results possible for Enron in the Texas market.  This is our \"home\" base - we need to make sure that our business efforts win big.  \n\nThanks for everything ya'll have been doing to achieve this result.\n\nJim"

Doug has been providing us with the necessary specific market information.  We have been successful in communicating that information to the new commissioners and Ercot and seeking resolution. The commission is definitely more responsive to market participants that are articulating the issue, providing specific examples and proposing the solution.  Grand-standing is ignored.  Those who show up with complaints but cannot point to specifics are virtually ignored.  Those who show up and complain, but are not participating in the working groups and the daily Ercot phone calls, board meetings, etc. are ignored.   \n\nDoug and I met with the Chairman of PUCT and have had subsequent conversations.  Thane and I also visited with him. \n\nPat Wood made a phone call to Tom Noel and told him to get the Texas market fixed.  (Even though he has bigger things to do in D.C., this is his legacy and he recognizes that if deregulation does not work in Texas, the repercussions could be global.)  \n\nChairman Sibley and Chairman Wolens (of the Texas legislature) are also engaged in market developments.  We have been working with the State Affairs legislative committee and keeping them apprised.  There is an Electric Restructuring Committee hearing scheduled for September 6th or 7th.  The forum is expected to be invited testimony only.  Those currently listed as invitees are PUCT Commissioners and Ercot's Sam Jones and Tom Noel.  The hearing is focused on the pilot and we have an opportunity to provide some probing questions for Wolens to direct to Sam and Tom.  Now that Sibley is not a candidate for Lt. Governor, there is more freedom to open up and ask some difficult questions.   \n\nThane is in Austin on Friday, but is available by phone.  I will be on a plane to Houston at 8:00 a.m. Can we find another time that works for us to meet? Thane is in an Ercot PRS meeting Friday from 9:30 until 3:00.  I am available after Rick's Friday budget meeting...are you available then?  You are right, we do need a formal plan, Thane has started an initial draft.

As important, the new PUCT Commissioners need some help right now in messaging the market.  Let's get them to support constructive solutions that will make a real difference.\n\nJean and Thane, I think that we need a FORMAL PLAN on what to do over the next 3 - 6 months to leverage this situation.  I would like to discuss this with you on Friday am.  I am free at 8am on Friday before Rick's budget meeting.\n\nJim\n\n"

Enron and NewEnergy\nabandoned this argument after reaching a settlement agreement with Edison.\nStaff and Edison argued that charges for energy imbalances are properly\naddressed within Edison's OATT and subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC.\n\n\n\tThe Commission concluded that in the interest of avoiding protracted\nlitigation and the harm of delay to retail competition, the Commission would\nnot address the propriety of FERC's asserted authority over energy imbalance\nissues.  The Commission indicated that its deferral to the FERC in no way\n\"waives its right to assert jurisdiction over energy imbalance service at\nsome future time.\"\n\n\t\t2.\tFactual & Policy Issues\n\n\tEdison proposed an energy imbalance service to retail customers\ncontaining the following provisions:\n\n*\tEnergy imbalance will be calculated separately for each hour and\nsettlements will occur on a cash basis for each hour's imbalances;\n*\tFor those RESs whose energy imbalance in an hour is 2% or less, or 2\nMW or less, settlement is made at 100% of out-of-pocket costs (\"OPC\"),\nregardless of the net imbalance or the direction of the error;\n*\n*\tThose RESs whose energy imbalances exceed 25% of their own\nindividual schedules will pay an adder or be charged a discount of 25% of\nOPC.  Adjustments are made to avoid double-counting of adders and discounts\napplicable to those RESs that are also subject to an adder or discount\nbelow.  These imbalance charges will be phased-in as follows:\n*\n*\tFrom October 1, 1999 through December 31, 1999 -- No adder  will\napply under this provision.\n*\n*\tFrom January 1, 2000 through March 31, 2000 -- 25% adder/discount\nwill apply to those RESs whose imbalances exceed 25% of their schedules 20%\nor more of the hours of the month.  If the 20% of the hours are exceeded,\nthe adder/discount shall apply to all hours.\n*\n*\tStarting April 1, 2000 -- 25% adder/discount will apply to those\nRESs whose imbalances exceed 25% of their schedules 10% or more of the hours\nof the month.  If the 10% of the hours are exceeded, the adder/discount\nshall apply to all hours.\n\n*\tEdison also applies a bandwidth to the total net energy imbalance\nattributable to unbundled retail load served by RESs.  If the hourly\nimbalance caused by all unbundled retail load, excluding PPO load, is within\nthe 100 MW bandwidth, no RES (except those whose imbalance exceeds ?25%, as\nnoted below) will be subject to an adder or discount.  PPO load will, in\naggregate, be subject to the same terms and conditions as above, but\nimbalance attributable to the PPO will be compared against a 100 MW deadband\nseparately from all RES load.\n\n*\tEdison will permit RESs to trade energy imbalances among themselves,\nto offset their imbalances at whatever prices and terms they wish, before\napplying a charge for energy imbalance.  According to Edison, this feature\nwill allow RESs to minimize energy imbalance charges by exchanging\noverscheduled megawatt-hours for underscheduled megawatt-hours in the same\nhour.  All remaining imbalances will be settled in cash at 100% of Edison's\nOPC.  Edison shall make available information on OPC ten days prior to the\nopening of the trading window.\n*\n*\tThe net retail energy imbalance in excess of 100 MW will be charged\nan adder or discount of 10%.  This charge will be allocated among RESs who\nare out of balance in the direction of the net and whose imbalance exceeds\ntheir individual deadband.  The allocation will be based on the ratio-share\nof the amount by which these individual RESs' imbalances exceed their\nindividual deadbands.  Any such adder/discount will be billed separately\nfrom charges for any imbalances remaining after trading. Likewise, any\nadder/discount attributable to the provisions of Paragraph 3 will be billed\nseparately from charges for any imbalances remaining after trading.\n*\n*\tLoad profiles will be developed using Dynamic Load Modeling with\nseasonal adjustments.

This revenue, less incremental cost of running the plants was the annual cash value of the plants which was then present valued.

                "Content": " JSTEFFE (Non-Privileged).pst\n\nAttached is the second draft of Enron's comments to FERC on ICAP.  The structure of the paper is summarised below:\n\n1.  RTO's are a positive step forward for the industry.\n2.  Spot markets are a necessary part of RTO development to ensure that the RTO can manage real time realiability.\n3.  A well functioning spot market eliminates the need for separate capacity type products such as ICAP, reserve margin (i.e. it achieves the objectives of iCap).  The paper incorporates theoretical and emperical evidence from other sectors of the economy and deregulation in other parts of the world to support this conclusion.\n4.  During the transition from a regulated environment to RTO's there may be a 'political' need for ICAP.  Specifically states that any interim proposal should be limited to 2 years after RTO implementation.\n5.  If that is the case, the paper sets out the two common theoretical platforms which can be used as a basis for ICAP.\n6.  Proposes two options based on the theroetical platforms.  \n\nWe would appreciate input on two issues.\n\nFirstly, Enron needs to make a decision on whether to limit our position to reliance on spot markets (i.e. don't suggest an interim solution).  While this is attractive, it is unlikely that Enron will get support from other participants (ICAP payments subsidize generation investment so no support from IPP's and consumers are not as confident as Enron that competitive markets will maintain reliability so they will want to sustain ICAP).\n\nSecondly, drafting comments on the paper generally.  Please note that the final section, that proposes the Enron solution, requires substantial redrafting which will be done if the consensus is to propose such a solution.\n\nA final draft will be sent out on the morning of Tuesday 10/16, the paper will be filed Wednesday.\n\nregards\nMike ext. 57634\n\nPS.  i don't want to sway opinion but i thought it may be useful to state my view.  I think that we concentrate on the rationale supporting RTO's and effective spot markets as mechanisms that achieve the goals of ICAP (i.e A spot market is Enrons solution).  Instead of proposing specific ICAP related solutions, we state that if others have different views, these should be debated in a specific FERC forum and any resulting separate iCap proposal if implemented should be interim in nature and minimise spot market distortions....\n\n "

IP claims that is losing $ MM because customers are not paying for Capacity.  This will impact our ability to \"go physical\" starting next year.\n\n2.\tMISO vs. ARTO\n\nIP is a member of the ARTO.  EPMI continues to try and establish only one RTO in the region.  I think this is why Dynegy won't state very clearly that 4 RTOs makes sense.  No $ impact, although this decision may impact our ability to \"go physical\" starting next year in Illinois.\n\n3.\tCTC Bet in ComEd\n\nMy recollection (talking with Harry K.) is that we pre-sold a CTC roll-off in ComEd that could cost our business around $10 MM if it doesn't happen.  Most talk in Illinois is that CTC should end early for big customers, so not sure if this is an issue.\n\n4.\tDelivery Service Tariff Litigation\n\nComEd and IP have filed to increase their rates on Delivery Service Tariffs (but not on Bundled customers because there is a statutory rate cap).  EES told us originally that this could cost as much as $50MM, but current estimates are closer to $10MM for ComEd and $2MM for IP.\n\n5.\tPPO (Power Purchase Option) Termination\n\nComEd is pushing to end the PPO service.  PPO provides a re-sell service to marketers while sharing the Mitigation Factor with customers.  It is the service we use to \"deliver\" today in ComEd.  IP will probably terminate this service because their stranded costs are expected to end sooner, hence, not a major issue for IP?\n\n6.\tRelative Size of Current EES Book\n\nComEd\t=\t7.8 MM Mwh (extends through 2010)\nIP\t=\t1.3 MM Mwh (extends through 2008)\n\nHope this helps.

NERC is about as secure as a convenience store at two in the morning.  They have almost no experience dealing with security, either cyber or otherwise. They are using the terrorist attacks on the 11th as a reason to blow the dust off all their old Y2K contingency plans and cash in on people's fears to strengthen their position.\n\nIn any case, I would suspect that a large RTO with a significant budget is much more likely to be secure than a dues based NERC. Look at NERC's offices.  They are in a shopping mall.  How secure is that?  Last time I visited, they didn't even have any sort of identity cards or badge system or anything - the whole place was wide open.  Anyone could walk in off the street and shut down a large portion of NERC's infrastructure by just randomly unplugging computers.  \n\nContrast that with places like ISO-NE and NY-ISO, who have significant levels of security in their systems that are extremely sophisticated and complex. Or compare that with the MISO's hardened facility, capable of withstanding an F-4 tornado hit.  You tell me whether NERC or RTOs are going to be more secure.\n\nDave is right on with his classification of the idea of NIMDA being an attack on the electric utility industry as preposterous.  That's akin to saying that a chain letter is an attack on the banking industry because bank statements come in the mail.  And Dan points out a more valid thing to consider - a terrorist isn't going to attack a tariff desk, market system, or security coordinator; they will attack nuclear units, substations, and other installations that actually matter.   \n\nI echo Dave's question - do we want to \"call\" NERC on this issue?  It would be a very simple exercise to point to NERC's many security failings, including some initiatives they are currently sitting on.  Bringing up the right details in the right forums could really undermine their reputation and nip this positioning in the bud.\n\n(By the way - am I the only one who got a kick out of that article pointing out this 3rd grade cleverness of \"NIMDA is ADMIN spelled backwards\"?  Gotta love journalists - always trying to find an angle.  Next they'll say that the 60 in \"2600\" refers to the frequency of the interconnection!)\n\n\nAndy Rodriquez \nRegulatory Affairs - Enron Corp. \nandy.rodriquez@enron.com \n713-345-3771 \n\n-----Original Message----- \nFrom: Nicolay, Christi L. \nSent: Wednesday, September 26, 2001 11:11 AM \nTo: Shapiro, Richard; Steffes, James D.; Robertson, Linda; Shelk, John; \nYeung, Charles; Ingersoll, Richard; Rodriquez, Andy; Novosel, Sarah; \nFulton, Donna; Alvarez, Ray; Roan, Michael; Maurer, Luiz; Connor, Joe; \nWalton, Steve; Comnes, Alan; Perrino, Dave; Staines, Dan; Fromer, \nHoward; Allegretti, Daniel; Hoatson, Tom; Twiggs, Thane; Shortridge, Pat \nSubject: FW: NERC Statements on Impact of Security Threats on RTOs \n\n\nOur NERC folks should be able to shed more light on why NERC is making statements that on their face look anti-large RTO (the other emails and comments in these document look more like \"this should be reviewed\".)\n\nDo we (and other market participants) need to have a computer systems group perform a study that includes redunancy issues, etc. to counter this?

The statements concern NERC's view of the implications of terrorist threats for FERC's \" Four RTO policy\" set forth in its July 12th Order.  The statements also may bear upon the effort to establish a new standards setting organization, particularly the possibility that NERC's responsibilities could be shifted to EISB.  Also attached is an article containing the views of R.J. Rudden Associates, Inc. that discusses the risks associated with centralizing control center operations.\n\nSpecifically, NERC representatives informed the press that on September 11 \"the grid was the target of an insidious cyber attack that shut down some facilities...from an information administration standpoint.\"  They noted that this resulted in service denials, although it is not clear whether they indicated where or how much.  This event was attributed to the so-called \"NIMBA virus\".\n\nNERC's statements suggest a new strategy to preserve the role they've played not only in security matters, but possibly other aspects pertaining to \"reliability standards.\"  They warn against any immediate transition to fewer RTOs as envisioned in FERC's July 12th Order.  Moreover, it is likely that NERC will argue that, given its expertise and experience, recent events make transitioning to a new standards organization (EISB?) ill advised.  \n\nIt is unclear what, if any, impact all this may have on RTO development, the legislative effort to establish a new reliability standards body or the NERC Board's consideration of pending reform proposals at its October meeting.  However, we can expect security related issues to be included in future discussions of these matters. \n\nPlease provide your reactions to the NERC statements to Mark Bennett at 202-628-8200 or mbennett@epsa.org \n"

Yesterday I spoke with Mark Bennett and Donn Salvosa of the EPSA staff.  Mark did the talking.  The upshot is that EPSA and EEI are meeting to see if they can't agree on reliability legislation.  EEI is working off of the NERC draft and has sent a version to EPSA dated 9/14 (see attached) that was the basis for last Thursday's meeting.  EPSA is now doing some drafting of its own.\n\nI need to read the 9/14 draft, but the fact that they are working off of the old NERC language is of considerable concern.  EPSA staff emphasizes the value of having EEI off the NERC reservation (which is good in terms of showing that there is NERC \"consensus\"), but I think EPSA staff may be \"too flexible\" in how they are approaching it.  I reminded them of our position and concerns and of Jim's prepared statement on EPSA's behalf filed for the Sept. 11 Barton hearing.  EPSA staff claims that other EPSA members are OK with them embarking on this project.\n\nIt is not clear if this effort will succeed.  EPSA staff said EEI's board insists on having engineers do reliability, which is objectionable to EPSA.

Spent a lot of time on how the=\n draft would aid and abet the recalcitrant utilities and that the overall n=\nature of the draft assumes there are only two parties to this -- FERC and t=\nhe transmission owners -- while the rest of those truly affected -- from us=\n to others -- are left out.

Jim Steffes is the EPSA witness on reliability and other issues at a Barton subcommittee hearing next Wed., Oct. 10th.  While the written testimony filed for the Sept. 11 hearing that was canceled is still operative, Jim's oral remarks can be whatever he wishes.  Also, even if he does not raise it in his opening statement, the issue will no doubt come up by others or in Q&A.\n\nThus -- any talking points need to be ready by Tuesday for this hearing.  Does not have to be anything fancy or hand-out quality.  Just something for Jim to consider using.  Charles, I do not recall any specific articles on what NERC said, but Sarah Novosel said she would check since she thought there was something like what you raised in your voice mail."

                "Content": " JSTEFFE (Non-Privileged).pst\n\nThis morning Enron was interviewed by the Federal Reserve, CFTC, SEC, and the Department of Treasury (also attending were the OCC and the FDIC).  Scott Gahn from the commercial group lead the discussion and Vicki Sharp (legal), Mark Taylor (legal) and I supported Scott on the legal and regulatory issues.\nThe goal in the meeting was to provide the agencies information so they can draft an interagency document on the retail swap market and its regulation by end of the year as required by the CFMA.\n\nGoing into the meeting we knew that the CFTC and the Fed were more likely to support the retail swap industry expansion, with the SEC and Treasury more interested in a regulatory structure that allows their \"clients\" , the banks and broker/dealers to offer the swaps and protect against systemic risk.  The agency which extended lead the meeting - in our case the CFTC.   The other firms interviewed are Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Lehman, JP Morgan-Chase, Bank of America, ISDA, and Blackbird.\n\nFirst, we noted that our targeted customers are the small to medium size business, not the residential consumer.  We argued that we can offer bundled retail swaps to those not meeting the eligible contract participant (ECP) requirements in deregulated markets where physically deliver is legal and possible, but unbundling the swap from the physical prohibits retail swaps to non-ECP customers.  This is a large markets (8.1 million potential mass market and small mass market customers) and the benefits of swaps to manage the volatility of deregulating markets should not be reserved to the Fortune 1,000.   The consumers would be full requirements consumers, so speculation would be managed.  If speculation and market manipulation were to occur state and common-law antifraud provisions are available.\n\nWe were able to isolate the SEC at the beginning the meeting by noting that we were not planning equity swaps.  The Treasury representative asked questions about manipulation, consumer protection, and the California situation for retail consumers.The OCC was concerned about coordination with state financial regulators and if this would be a barrier to market entry.\n\nThe USG agency officials acknowledged that the retail swaps in energy and other commodities were useful risk management products, but some disagree as the regulatory treatment. At the end of meeting, Treasury said that \"do you expect us to exempt Enron solely in from regulation in offering these products?\".  We said yes if we are willing to offer sound risk management products to our customers \n\nBest development: The CFTC official pulled us aside after the meeting and said that while Treasury may not willing to solely exempting Enron, the CFTC has the authority and is willing to consider just an exemption.  The CFTC is  interested in acting quickly to offer regulatory relief and legal certainty for those firms interested in offering these products under the ECP level.  She wants to sit down with us very shortly to decide how best to get move this at the CFTC, either through a formal rulemaking or no action letter.   The goal would be to act before the swap report is released in December, avoid legislative changes (which we strongly oppose), and allow for product innovation.\n\nCall with any questions and I will keep you updated."

I will be on the cal=\nl on Monday and plan to participate on Wednesday via conference call.   I c=\nan be available to be in New York if necessary.=20\n\nKen Raisler, with Sullivan and Cromwell in New York, brought this to my att=\nention in late June.   Ken and I worked on the swap language as part of the=\n Commodities Futures Modernization Act (CFMA) last year and Linda Robertson=\n and Larry Decker worked on the issue from the Department of Treasury.\nWe have worked closely with Mark Taylor and his colleagues in legal on thes=\nes issues.\n\nI sat in on a call with the commercial team last week to see what sort of r=\netail swap products we would offer, if we decide to offer any.  Attached ar=\ne their preliminary product offerings which are being reworked.\n\n  =20\n\nAt the time the CFMA passage, Enron did not anticipate entering the retail =\nswap market.  The issue of retail swaps was quite controversial and was one=\n of the primary issues that delayed passage of the CFMA.  Because of the co=\nntroversy, the final language in the Act requires the Commodity Futures Tra=\nding Commission (CFTC), the Board of the Governors fo the Federal Reserve, =\n(the Fed), the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the Secretary =\nof Treasury to study the issues associated with the offer and sale of retai=\nl swap products and report no later than a year after passage ( by the end =\nof 2001).  The request to interview Enron came from the CFTC.  On August 2,=\n 2001 the CFTC, Fed, SEC, and Treasury (the FDIC and the Office of the Comp=\ntroller of the Currency will also participate) will interview 7 or 8 partie=\ns at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.   I know that ISDA and AIG have =\nbeen requested to interview, and assume Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, JP M=\norgan are among the others.   We have agreed to the interview and understan=\nd  the responses will be confidential.    I  will fax you the request lette=\nr so you can see the questions that they want addressed.\n\nCONCERNS:\n\n1)  Likely the other entities that are being interviewed are regulated...we=\n must not say anything which would indicate that our current business needs=\n further regulation.\n2)  We had a significant victory in the much lauded Swap exemption, which p=\nrovides an exemption from the CEA for energy and metal swaps, except in cas=\nes of fraud and manipulation.  I do NOT want to have to reopen the CEA with=\n amendments, because the current political environment could lead to a loss=\n of or meddling in the current exemption.\n3)  I am concerned that any indication of offering retail swaps on EnronOnl=\nine, could lead to a greater interest in regulation of EnronOnline.\n4)  Retail swaps will be regulated, likely by the CFTC.  Are we prepared to=\n enter a regulated business?  Is there regulatory creep into our existing b=\nusiness?  Do we have other regulators take greater interest in Enron activi=\nties?  It may be too late for this last question.\n\nLook forward to talking more about this.\n=20\n\n\n\n\n=09James D Steffes/ENRON@enronXgate 07/20/2001 09:26 AM =09   To: Chris Lon=\ng/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Lisa Yoho/NA/Enron@Enron  cc: Linda Robertson/NA/Enron@=\nENRON, Richard Shapiro/ENRON@enronXgate, Vicki Sharp/HOU/EES@EES  Subject: =\nCFTC Request for Information on Retail Swaps for Enron Direct Customers=09\n\n\nChris & Lisa --\n\nEES has been requested by the CFTC to present at a closed-door session on t=\nhe matter of retail swaps for energy products to small customers (dry clean=\ners, etc.).  The meeting with the CFTC is scheduled to be on Aug 2.  Right =\nnow Scott Gahn (the head of Enron Direct USA) is scheduled to testify. =20\n\nVicki Sharp has scheduled some meetings prior to this to make sure that Enr=\non has its story straight.  The key question is whether or not Enron would =\naccept \"regulation\" by the CFTC for purposes of swaps to these customers. =\n=20\n\nThe first meeting would be a phone call on Monday at 10am (CST) to open dis=\ncussions.  The second meeting would be a hands-on discussion on Wednesday b=\neginning at 8am (CST).  I think that both Lisa and Chris should attend both=\n meetings to make sure that we understand the politics and risks.  One key =\nquestion is whether or not the CEA (as it currently stands) would allow thi=\ns activity.\n\nPlease let me know if this works for everyone.\n\nJim\n"

Basically, TXU and Reliant felt that they did not have enough time to compare the PUC staff's rate estimates to their own analysis.  Therefore, the commissioners instructed the Utilities to meet and work with the PUC staff over the next week so that both parties can reach an agreement on  the necessary rate schedules applicable to their service territories.  The deadline for their motion for reconsideration is May 17th.\n\nIn regards to the TXU fuel factor case (Dkt. 23640),  Commissioner Wood indicated that we have two viable options:  1)  We could look at each utility on a case by case basis and decide whether or not we want to include the surcharge in the Price to Beat (PTB) period starting January 1, 2002.  Or, 2) We could make this surcharge a part of the True-up process in 2004.  Wood indicated that Option 1 would undoubtedly increase head room (approximately 4/10 of cent  per kwh was his estimate).  However, Wood saw benefit in Option two because it would serve as a hedge against the possibility of a Utility having negative stranded investment.  Wood said that he could see both sides of it because on the one hand you had \"a head room enhancer\" and on the other hand you have a \"negative stranded cost off-set.\"  Wood ultimately deferred to Commissioner Perlman who made the decision to include the fuel surcharge in the true-up process in 2004 (Option 2).\n\nCKL"

Stan feels=\n that if HB 1148 becomes law our tower and radio sites would need contant a=\ndministrative and legal attention to stay in compliance with the rules.  He=\n feels that this bill is far more costly and burdensome to Enron than the c=\nurrent Federal Regulations.  Stan also feels that if HB 1492 becomes law th=\nen the State of Texas could force us (Enron)  to go beyond the Federal Regu=\nlations (47 C. F. R. Part 17) by requiring us (Enron) to adopt more stringe=\nnt standards for all antenna structures less than 200 feet. The current Fed=\neral Regulations that are in place relate solely to antenna structures that=\n are greater than 200 feet and/or fall within the glide slope curves of air=\nports or other aviation type facilities.\n\nAs a side note, I sent a copy of these two bills along with Stan's analysis=\n to Scott Bolton and Sue Nord on Monday of this week and I have not gotten =\nany response from either of them.\n\nIf you look below you will find: a copy of the most recent bill, a full his=\ntory, and a Word document from Stan Nelson where he explains in detail the =\neffects of these two Bills (HB 1148 and HB 1492) on Enron.\n\nStan Nelson's Comments:\n   =20\n=09=09=09=09=09=09=09\n=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09HB 1492\n\n\nfg   H Filed 2-12-01 30%   H Introduced and referred to committee on House =\nTransportation  2-13-01 29%   H Hearing set for 2:00 P.M. or Adj., E2.030  =\n-- House Transportation 4-17-01 36%   H Committee action pending House Tran=\nsportation  4-17-01 18%   H Voted favorably from committee as substituted H=\nouse Transportation  4-18-01 54%   H Reported from committee as substituted=\n House Transportation  4-26-01 55%   =09\n\n\n\n\nHB 1492=20\n\n=20\n\n\n=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09HB 1148\n\n\n   House  Description of Action Date Stat   H Filed 2- 1-01 30%   H Introdu=\nced and referred to committee on House County Affairs  2- 7-01 29%   H Hear=\ning set for 7:30 A.M., E1.026  -- House County Affairs 3-21-01 36%   H Comm=\nittee action pending House County Affairs  3-21-01 18%   H Voted favorably =\nfrom committee as substituted House County Affairs  4- 4-01 54%   H Reporte=\nd from committee as substituted House County Affairs  4-16-01 55%   H Set o=\nn the House Calendar 4-25-01 54%   H Laid out for discussion 3:50pm 4-25-01=\n    H Committee substitute adopted 4-25-01 70%   H 1 Floor amendment(s) ado=\npted  4-25-01 65%   H Passed to third reading 4-25-01 70%   H Laid out for =\ndiscussion 3:03pm 4-26-01    H Passed 4-26-01 67%   S Received in the Senat=\ne - Referred to Senate Business and Commerce  4-30-01 68%   =09\n\n\n\n\n\nHB 1148\n\n=20\n\n\nCKL\n\n\n\n<Embedded Picture (Device Independent Bitmap)>"

He very promptly gathered the necessary info and completed a model that was thoughtfully constructed and accurate.  He is clearly a self starter and demonstrated a good udnerstanding of finance fundamentals.  When he had questions or needed help, he asked for it.  I encourgage this, particularly when there is a tight timeframe, so that valuable time is not lost.  Chad has demonstrated a real interest in his work and commitment to excellence.  \n\nI wanted to to have these data points in preparation for the upcoming PRC meeting.

A Certified Capital Company means a partnership, corporation, or trust or limited liability  company, whether organized on a profit or not-for-profit basis, that has as its primary business activity the investment of cash in qualified businesses and that is certifed as meeting the criteria of this subchapter.  \n\nThe comptroller by rule shall establish the application procedures for certifed capital companiesTo qualify as a certified capital company,  the applicant must have:\nAt the time of application for certification, an equity capitalization of at least $500, 000 in the form of unencumbered cash or cash equivalents;\nAt least two principals or persons employed to manage the funds of the applicant\nMust have at least four years of experience in the venture capital industry   \n\nThese Cap Co's partner with Certified Investors (e.g. insurance companies or other person that has a state premium tax liability) to unlock the value of the premium tax credits.  This partnership involves the Certified Investor contributing capital to the Cap. Co.  in exchange for an allocation by the Cap Co. of premium tax credits to the Certified Investor.   Cap Co's use this certified capital to invest in Early stage businesses across the state of Texas.\n\n\nUnder SB 601, the Cap Co's are only allowed to make \"qualified distributions\" or payments.  These qualified distributions include:  the reasonable costs and expenses of forming, syndicating, managing, and operating the company, provided that the distribution or payment is not made directly or indirectly to a certified investor or an affiliate of a certified investor, including:  (i) reasonable and necessary fees paid for professional services, including legal and accounting services, related to the formation and operation of the company; and (ii) an annual management fee in an amount that does not exceed two and one-half percent of the value of the assets of the company.\n\nCKL\n\n\n\n\n<Embedded Picture (Device Independent Bitmap)>"
